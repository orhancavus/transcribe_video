Tanya Cushman Reviewer's name

2
0:00:04,300000 --> 0:00:07,800000
How can we use the power of pictures at work?

3
0:00:08,700000 --> 0:00:12,700000
How can you visualize what you think, what you know,

4
0:00:12,700000 --> 0:00:16,500000
and make that accessible for others to improve collaboration?

5
0:00:17,200000 --> 0:00:20,400000
I have been obsessed with this question for 30 years,

6
0:00:20,400000 --> 0:00:25,020000
in 20 books, in 200 articles, in more than dozens of experiments.

7
0:00:25,840000 --> 0:00:30,200000
And what I found are amazing benefits that happen when you draw,

8
0:00:30,560000 --> 0:00:33,580000
when you use visualization software, when you sketch, when you doodle.

9
0:00:33,900000 --> 0:00:38
You boost your creativity, you improve collaboration and communication,

10
0:00:38,120000 --> 0:00:39,060000
have better conflicts.

11
0:00:40,100000 --> 0:00:43,060000
And you also improve your decision quality

12
0:00:43,060000 --> 0:00:45,660000
when you visualize the information that you have.

13
0:00:46,540000 --> 0:00:52,760000
But what I also found was that many of us don't use the potential of visualization at all.

14
0:00:53,560000 --> 0:00:56,940000
We stick to old ways of presenting, of discussing.

15
0:00:57,740000 --> 0:00:58,640000
Can I ask you this?

16
0:00:59,680000 --> 0:01:04,460000
Who among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?

17
0:01:04,940000 --> 0:01:05,160000
Who loves to sit through that? Okay, we have four people. Anyone among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?

18
0:01:05,160000 --> 0:01:06,880000
Who loves to sit through that?

19
0:01:06,880000 --> 0:01:10,800000
Okay, we have four people.

20
0:01:10,800000 --> 0:01:12,640000
For the rest, can you give me alternatives?

21
0:01:12,640000 --> 0:01:15,520000
What can you do instead of bombarding people with slides?

22
0:01:15,520000 --> 0:01:18,600000
What would be a visual way of working?

23
0:01:18,600000 --> 0:01:19,980000
Storytelling.

24
0:01:19,980000 --> 0:01:20,980000
What else?

25
0:01:20,980000 --> 0:01:21,980000
Prezi.

26
0:01:21,980000 --> 0:01:22,980000
Prezi.

27
0:01:22,980000 --> 0:01:23,980000
Yes.

28
0:01:23,980000 --> 0:01:24,980000
Sketching.

29
0:01:24,980000 --> 0:01:29,100000
What else? Mind mapping. Whiteboard, right? There are many ways

30
0:01:29,100000 --> 0:01:34,760000
when you invite people to visualize with you, to co-create what you're actually doing. And this

31
0:01:34,760000 --> 0:01:49,760000
is the first of many visual metaphors to come. You're sort of laying out a mini red carpet to invite them to shine. It's also a red thread that the conversation has

32
0:01:49,760000 --> 0:01:56
when you invite others to visualize with you. So what I'd like to share in the next five to six

33
0:01:56 --> 0:02:01,580000
minutes with you are three practices that help you to invite others to visualize together.

34
0:02:03,720000 --> 0:02:08,720000
But first, can I take you back just a minute to my very first high-stakes presentation,

35
0:02:08,720000 --> 0:02:15,020000
not as a university professor, but in my former life as a consultant.

36
0:02:15,020000 --> 0:02:19,160000
Client had asked us to analyze if they should enter a new multi-billion market.

37
0:02:19,160000 --> 0:02:26,420000
And we worked very hard to analyze this market, and I had produced about 40 data-driven slides to show the client that we

38
0:02:26,420000 --> 0:02:32,560000
had worked hard and that he should not enter this business. Just as I was ready to go and

39
0:02:32,560000 --> 0:02:39,500000
bombard the client with those slides, my then boss said, Martin, take a seat. Hold your horses.

40
0:02:40,560000 --> 0:02:46,480000
And instead of me going through the slides, he showed the perplexed audience one sketch,

41
0:02:47,140000 --> 0:02:49,820000
one visual metaphor, and it was this one.

42
0:02:49,820000 --> 0:02:52,600000
It was a fortress built on sand.

43
0:02:53,880000 --> 0:02:58,260000
This guy had just summarized all of my 40 slides in a single image

44
0:02:58,260000 --> 0:02:59,480000
because he was right.

45
0:02:59,700000 --> 0:03:02,220000
This new market was like a fortress,

46
0:03:02,540000 --> 0:03:05,720000
very hard to conquer because of patent shields, economies

47
0:03:05,720000 --> 0:03:07,560000
of scale contracts.

48
0:03:07,560000 --> 0:03:12,520000
It was not even worth conquering, it was sinking into the sand so to speak, because the technology

49
0:03:12,520000 --> 0:03:15,540000
was being replaced by another one.

50
0:03:15,540000 --> 0:03:19,340000
And of course the client then asked about details like the patent analysis I had done

51
0:03:19,340000 --> 0:03:26,800000
or the contracts and so forth, and I could show finally my slide with that analysis. But this leading with a visual

52
0:03:26,800000 --> 0:03:31,720000
metaphor really changed the dynamics of the conversation. It was much more collaborative.

53
0:03:32,240000 --> 0:03:38,160000
First, the overview with this visual metaphor, and then the details on demand. And I realized

54
0:03:38,160000 --> 0:03:43,180000
it's all about a conversation. It's much better this way. When you first show overview with the

55
0:03:43,180000 --> 0:03:48,340000
help of a metaphor that, by the way way the client picked up and used also verbally.

56
0:03:48,340000 --> 0:03:50,840000
And that got me thinking as a researcher.

57
0:03:50,840000 --> 0:03:55,560000
And in many experiments with managers and students we found three practices that I want

58
0:03:55,560000 --> 0:04:06,860000
to share with you that you can use to really reap the power of pictures professionally, and the first one might shock you, especially the design

59
0:04:06,860000 --> 0:04:11,080000
aficionados among you.

60
0:04:11,080000 --> 0:04:17,380000
If you want visualization, graphic representations to work for you and for collaboration, make

61
0:04:17,380000 --> 0:04:20,820000
them ugly.

62
0:04:20,820000 --> 0:04:22,680000
Beauty is the enemy of collaboration.

63
0:04:22,680000 --> 0:04:28,920000
If something looks too nice, it looks like it doesn't need revision or improvement. I call this the museum effect.

64
0:04:28,920000 --> 0:04:33,520000
People just stare and say, yeah, that looks perfect, and the thinking stops there.

65
0:04:33,520000 --> 0:04:37,480000
So you want to use the power of provisionality.

66
0:04:37,480000 --> 0:04:41,320000
You want to signal with your drawings, this is work in progress,

67
0:04:41,320000 --> 0:04:44,880000
and invite collaboration in this way. So this is good news for all of us who are

68
0:04:44,880000 --> 0:04:47,320000
terrible at drawing.

69
0:04:47,320000 --> 0:04:49,900000
So it's not a bug, it's a feature.

70
0:04:49,900000 --> 0:04:54,880000
The technical term is low perceived finishness.

71
0:04:54,880000 --> 0:04:56,320000
It looks provisional.

72
0:04:56,320000 --> 0:04:58,660000
It invites collaboration.

73
0:04:58,660000 --> 0:05:04,120000
And by the way, banks and telecom companies and insurances have been using this all along.

74
0:05:04,120000 --> 0:05:05,200000
It's called pencil selling.

75
0:05:06,040000 --> 0:05:08,180000
When instead of using shiny slides,

76
0:05:08,280000 --> 0:05:11,820000
you just sketch something with a pencil for a client, like a product.

77
0:05:12,520000 --> 0:05:15,900000
In our experiments, we were able to show this actually is much better.

78
0:05:16 --> 0:05:16,900000
It leads to more sales.

79
0:05:17,300000 --> 0:05:20,680000
So if you want to harness the power of visualization for collaboration,

80
0:05:21,300000 --> 0:05:22,360000
make them look ugly.

81
0:05:22,880000 --> 0:05:24,180000
Make them look provisional.

82
0:05:24,320000 --> 0:05:26,160000
Use sketches and doodles.

83
0:05:26,160000 --> 0:05:31,440000
We've shown in our experiments even little tweaks to software to make it look more sketchy

84
0:05:31,440000 --> 0:05:37,720000
boosts collaboration and creativity. And this brings me to the second advice I'd like to

85
0:05:37,720000 --> 0:05:45,880000
share with you. Like my boss, lead with visual metaphors. Don't just use diagrams, although they are powerful,

86
0:05:46,300000 --> 0:05:53,140000
or charts, or maps. Visual metaphors are magical. They access what people already know.

87
0:05:54,200000 --> 0:06:01,240000
They bring out new solution ideas. They make things much more concrete, like a mini red carpet

88
0:06:01,240000 --> 0:06:05,960000
or a red thread. Let me give you an example. In a study that we originally did for

89
0:06:05,960000 --> 0:06:14,100000
BMW Financial Services and then published, we used the identical strategy of BMW and communicated it

90
0:06:14,100000 --> 0:06:20,820000
to different staff members, groups. Once we used standard bullet point slides, then we used a

91
0:06:20,820000 --> 0:06:26,120000
diagram. And for the third group, we used the mountain trail visual metaphor

92
0:06:26,120000 --> 0:06:28,860000
with the same content as the other two.

93
0:06:29 --> 0:06:29,700000
And guess what?

94
0:06:30,400000 --> 0:06:34,800000
For the group where we visualized through the mountain trail the strategy,

95
0:06:35,100000 --> 0:06:38,280000
not only did they remember a lot more later on,

96
0:06:39,200000 --> 0:06:42,420000
they were also much more motivated to implement the strategy.

97
0:06:43,600000 --> 0:06:46
Now, I've never met a metaphor I didn't like,

98
0:06:46,720000 --> 0:06:52,480000
but clearly not all metaphors are equally well suited. You want to make sure that the metaphor

99
0:06:52,480000 --> 0:06:56,960000
is simpler than what you're trying to explain, that it's concrete and that people have a

100
0:06:56,960000 --> 0:07:00,800000
connection with it. And that is hopefully the right connection. I will never use again

101
0:07:01,360000 --> 0:07:07,880000
the volcano metaphor as I did once for creativity in a country that is at risk of active volcanoes.

102
0:07:07,880000 --> 0:07:10,440000
So choose your metaphors well,

103
0:07:10,440000 --> 0:07:13,720000
and if you do that, then it will resonate with people,

104
0:07:13,720000 --> 0:07:15,560000
it will be much more memorable,

105
0:07:15,560000 --> 0:07:18,720000
it sticks like a red ribbon on the floor.

106
0:07:18,720000 --> 0:07:22,560000
Here's another example of such a visual metaphor.

107
0:07:22,560000 --> 0:07:27,120000
It can come from nature, it can come from technology, it can come from mythology, you name it.

108
0:07:27,120000 --> 0:07:30,600000
Here, I used the bridge to visualize a few,

109
0:07:30,600000 --> 0:07:32,720000
I'm a professor of communications management,

110
0:07:32,720000 --> 0:07:35,600000
a few communication problems.

111
0:07:35,600000 --> 0:07:38,220000
And so it's simple, also visually,

112
0:07:38,220000 --> 0:07:42,680000
and the beauty of this kind of visual,

113
0:07:42,680000 --> 0:07:44,800000
we can learn that from comic strips,

114
0:07:44,800000 --> 0:07:49,240000
is that it starts a series that people then want to complete.

115
0:07:49,240000 --> 0:07:51,760000
And I think that's very powerful in collaboration.

116
0:07:51,760000 --> 0:07:56,040000
I call this third practice that I want to share with you in conclusion,

117
0:07:56,040000 --> 0:07:59,080000
I call this visual variation.

118
0:07:59,080000 --> 0:08:02,600000
You use a metaphor or a diagram, and then you vary it.

119
0:08:02,600000 --> 0:08:05,880000
You repeat it, but slightly differently. And the magic

120
0:08:05,880000 --> 0:08:10,580000
that this does for collaboration is people start to extend the series you're giving them. So for

121
0:08:10,580000 --> 0:08:16,640000
example here, communication is one-sided because of a lack of listening, right? One-way street,

122
0:08:16,820000 --> 0:08:22,160000
or the bridge is not aligned, there's misunderstandings, or it's too full, the too many

123
0:08:22,160000 --> 0:08:27,200000
messages crowd out the key message, and people automatically think of other communication problems

124
0:08:27,200000 --> 0:08:28,640000
through the metaphor of the bridge.

125
0:08:28,720000 --> 0:08:31,240000
Like one car going off the bridge,

126
0:08:31,340000 --> 0:08:33,780000
maybe because the person is too emotional, right?

127
0:08:33,880000 --> 0:08:35,240000
Or the bridge being shaky,

128
0:08:35,380000 --> 0:08:37,660000
maybe because there is no trust in the relationship.

129
0:08:38,440000 --> 0:08:40,860000
Visual metaphors spark the imagination,

130
0:08:42,100000 --> 0:08:48,280000
especially if they come in a series of images. This is by the way

131
0:08:48,280000 --> 0:08:55,040000
a very empirically validated theory, it's called variation theory, and it basically

132
0:08:55,040000 --> 0:09:00,460000
says that you do not understand anything until you understand it in more than one

133
0:09:00,460000 --> 0:09:06,240000
way. And so if you ask me for advice how to make visuals more part of your everyday

134
0:09:06,240000 --> 0:09:11,480000
work, I would say start a series, start a simple image. It doesn't have to be sophisticated and

135
0:09:11,480000 --> 0:09:18,940000
invite others to build on that. Here's my final example for that. As a university professor,

136
0:09:18,940000 --> 0:09:25,500000
we often advise students, and many of our students still have this stereotypical career path in mind

137
0:09:25,500000 --> 0:09:29,220000
that it only goes upward in terms of salary or hierarchy.

138
0:09:29,360000 --> 0:09:34,380000
And I drew this visual variation to invite them to think about alternative career trajectories.

139
0:09:34,500000 --> 0:09:36,300000
So the career doesn't have to be linear.

140
0:09:36,300000 --> 0:09:39,420000
In fact, I find, I don't know how about you,

141
0:09:40,060000 --> 0:09:43,820000
that the most intriguing careers are often non-linear,

142
0:09:44,580000 --> 0:09:48,240000
are different than this upward staircase model.

143
0:09:49,820000 --> 0:09:53,780000
So in conclusion, go forth and visualize or vanish,

144
0:09:53,940000 --> 0:09:55,180000
use the power of pictures,

145
0:09:55,500000 --> 0:09:57,900000
and when you do that, you will see it boosts your creativity,

146
0:09:58,180000 --> 0:09:59,160000
it improves decisions,

147
0:09:59,580000 --> 0:10:04,240000
especially if you use images that signal that they are a work in progress,

148
0:10:04,240000 --> 0:10:08,940000
that invite others, like a red carpet to shine together,

149
0:10:09,340000 --> 0:10:11,900000
to co-create something new together.

150
0:10:12,980000 --> 0:10:17,160000
Especially if you don't just rely on abstract diagrams or charts,

151
0:10:17,480000 --> 0:10:21,800000
but use the power of visual metaphors to activate what people already know.

152
0:10:22,560000 --> 0:10:25,720000
And thirdly, of course, if you don't just use a single image

153
0:10:25,720000 --> 0:10:28,680000
and overload that one, but start a sequence

154
0:10:28,680000 --> 0:10:30,940000
that your colleagues can build upon.

155
0:10:30,940000 --> 0:10:32,240000
Thank you very much.
