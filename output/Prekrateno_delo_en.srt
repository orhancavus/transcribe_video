1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
The Prosecutor's Office has stopped the case for the revocation of the case.

2
0:00:05,000000 --> 0:00:05,990000
After 31 years of investigation, the Prosecutor's Office has stopped the case for the revocation of the case.

3
0:00:10,000000 --> 0:00:10,990000
This happened after the last accusation was filed against him, former Prime Minister Georgi Tanasov.

4
0:00:16,000000 --> 0:00:16,990000
Maria Yotova's stories return to us in these dark times, for which there will be no justice.

5
0:00:21,000000 --> 0:00:21,990000
Maria, hello.

6
0:00:22,000000 --> 0:00:22,990000
Hello.

7
0:00:23,000000 --> 0:00:23,990000
What do you know about the case? The case, as you said, has been going on for more than 30 years.

8
0:00:28,000000 --> 0:00:28,990000
In the beginning, we blame the instigation of ethnic discrimination and racism

9
0:00:32,000000 --> 0:00:32,990000
of Todor Zhivkov, Dimitra Stoyanov, Pencho Kobadinsky and Georgi Atanasov.

10
0:00:36,000000 --> 0:00:36,990000
After that, they are qualified in military duties and crimes.

11
0:00:40,000000 --> 0:00:40,990000
I will not go into details about the case.

12
0:00:42,000000 --> 0:00:42,990000
30 years is a lot of time, but the people I talked to told me that this was an imitation of the judiciary,

13
0:00:51,000000 --> 0:00:51,990000
a game of democracy and that this case was sabotaged from the very beginning.

14
0:00:57,000000 --> 0:00:57,990000
The fact that the last defendant has died was just the final point,

15
0:01:01,000000 --> 0:01:01,990000
it was factological to pretend that everything is fine.

16
0:01:03,000000 --> 0:01:03,990000
How do you accept that there are no defendants? The refusal of the judiciary and the lack of it is something that is very difficult to accept.

17
0:01:10,000000 --> 0:01:10,990000
What they prove is that if these people remain guilty in history, it can be a form of the judiciary.

18
0:01:20,000000 --> 0:01:20,990000
But for this purpose, for all this, we need to fight, including the media, including the topic, to be included in the history textbooks.

19
0:01:27,000000 --> 0:01:27,990000
Let's see. Thank you.

20
0:01:34,000000 --> 0:01:34,990000
This is a personal drama for all the Turks in Bulgaria.

21
0:01:37,000000 --> 0:01:37,990000
Very few are the people who have not been affected by what is happening in our newest history.

22
0:01:43,000000 --> 0:01:43,990000
from what is happening in our modern history.

23
0:01:47,000000 --> 0:01:47,990000
They wanted us to become Bulgarians. The purpose of the living rule was to create a single nation.

24
0:01:52,000000 --> 0:01:52,990000
The man, freed from the reins of the race, became free.

25
0:01:58,000000 --> 0:01:58,990000
The process of the revolution should not use this term,

26
0:02:02,000000 --> 0:02:02,990000
because it is a hoax with the Bulgarian Renaissance and with the children of that Renaissance.

27
0:02:08,000000 --> 0:02:08,990000
In fact, no one is rebelling, but a similar policy is being carried out against our minorities,

28
0:02:15,000000 --> 0:02:15,990000
mainly against the Muslims, whether they are Turks, Pamacians or Roma.

29
0:02:20,000000 --> 0:02:20,990000
The case was being dragged on, and in the end none of the culprits who were the initiators of this campaign and the ideologists remained.

30
0:02:31,600000 --> 0:02:39,600000
I think it was Georgi Atanasov who died last. And after that, the case went to the archive. No one to judge.

31
0:02:39,600000 --> 0:02:46
Three options. Either we will re-unite them and make them our own socialist Turks,

32
0:02:46,000000 --> 0:02:46,990000
or we will bring them to Turkey and if neither of them gives good results, we will make them Bulgarians.

33
0:02:53,000000 --> 0:02:53,990000
Open the borders for all Bulgarian Muslims who want to go to Turkey or to stay and live there.

34
0:03:08,280000 --> 0:03:08,520000
We will make the politics Bulgarians.

35
0:03:11,800000 --> 0:03:11,920000
It takes place from 1969 to 1989.

36
0:03:15,920000 --> 0:03:16,520000
After a decision at the end of 1969 at the Politburo,

37
0:03:22,480000 --> 0:03:22,760000
with which all ethnocultural rights of the Turkish population are limited,

38
0:03:24,960000 --> 0:03:25
publications and publications in Turkish, the study of the Turkish language was liquidated for several years. Turkish population. We published Turkish-language publications.

39
0:03:25,000000 --> 0:03:25,990000
Until a few years, the study of Turkish language was cancelled.

40
0:03:28,000000 --> 0:03:28,990000
There were three theaters closed.

41
0:03:31,000000 --> 0:03:31,990000
There were periodicals closed.

42
0:03:34,000000 --> 0:03:34,990000
In 1984, the Turks only have their names left.

43
0:03:39,000000 --> 0:03:39,990000
Nothing else to prove that they are Turks.

44
0:03:42,000000 --> 0:03:42,990000
to find out that they are Turks.

45
0:03:50,000000 --> 0:03:50,990000
I was 29 years old. I actually understood what the situation was,

46
0:03:52,000000 --> 0:03:52,990000
because I had a colleague from Kyrgyzstan,

47
0:03:54,000000 --> 0:03:54,990000
we studied together, he was coming to stay with us.

48
0:03:57,000000 --> 0:03:57,990000
And a year before, he came and said,

49
0:04:00,000000 --> 0:04:00,990000
Eval, the Turks are bravo to you.

50
0:04:03,000000 --> 0:04:03,990000
I said, what's going on?

51
0:04:04,000000 --> 0:04:04,990000
We are already Bulgarians!''

52
0:04:06,000000 --> 0:04:06,990000
He said, ''In Kyrgyzstan?''

53
0:04:11,000000 --> 0:04:11,990000
I don't know. It's very personal for me, because my mother took it very hard.

54
0:04:20,000000 --> 0:04:20,990000
Because I understood what was going on in Rod family experience and I was a little prepared.

55
0:04:26,600000 --> 0:04:29,600000
I went to my mother and we talked about the names.

56
0:04:29,600000 --> 0:04:34,400000
Who, how to say, so that it doesn't happen that they put us random names,

57
0:04:34,400000 --> 0:04:38,400000
and the person can't tell you who is his mother, who is his father, who is his brother,

58
0:04:38,400000 --> 0:04:41,400000
your child with another name and so on.

59
0:04:41,400000 --> 0:04:42,400000
Other names.

60
0:04:42,400000 --> 0:04:42,900000
Yes.

61
0:04:42,900000 --> 0:04:44,900000
What name did you choose for yourself?

62
0:04:44,900000 --> 0:04:45
Ivelin. Ivelin Karaslava. with other names and so on. Other names. What name did you choose for yourself?

63
0:04:45,000000 --> 0:04:45,990000
Ivelin Karaslava.

64
0:04:50,000000 --> 0:04:50,990000
In 1973 I was 15 years old.

65
0:04:54,000000 --> 0:04:54,990000
When the protesting population of the village of the square was killed by five people and many others were injured.

66
0:05:09,000000 --> 0:05:09,990000
My uncle was killed and my uncle, who was 45 years old.

67
0:05:14,000000 --> 0:05:14,990000
We were loaded with trucks, discovered in winter in the largest place on March 28, we were scattered or settled separately in the villages of northwest Bulgaria.

68
0:05:30,500000 --> 0:05:40
After that, they did not allow us to go back, so we stayed for about 7 years to live in a village in Toulbukhne.

69
0:05:40,000000 --> 0:05:40,990000
It was then that we again opposed the change of names.

70
0:05:45,500000 --> 0:05:48
Our names had not been changed until then.

71
0:05:48,000000 --> 0:05:48,990000
We were put in prison for everything that was happening, the world did not know.

72
0:05:53,500000 --> 0:05:57,500000
Six students were released at night.

73
0:05:57,500000 --> 0:06:02,500000
We crossed the Bulgar-Roman border and tried to enter the Turkish embassy

74
0:06:02,500000 --> 0:06:08
to inform the public, the world public public about what was happening in the embassy.

75
0:06:08,000000 --> 0:06:08,990000
We were detained by the Romanian police.

76
0:06:12,000000 --> 0:06:12,990000
After the investigation, we were returned back to Bulgaria, after which there was a trial.

77
0:06:20,000000 --> 0:06:20,990000
When we entered prison, in 1985, I was the oldest, I was 27 years old.

78
0:06:25,500000 --> 0:06:27
We were four.

79
0:06:27,000000 --> 0:06:27,990000
We were in prison for 17 months.

80
0:06:31,000000 --> 0:06:31,990000
It's not easy to fight. You have to be ready to lose your freedom, your health, even your life.

81
0:06:39,000000 --> 0:06:39,990000
But in the end, for us, this was a value that no one had the right to take away from us.

82
0:06:45,840000 --> 0:06:52,840000
No one has the right to decide that everything must be taken out of their mind one day

83
0:06:52,840000 --> 0:06:56,640000
and to live, to become what they want.

84
0:06:56,640000 --> 0:07:02,240000
This is really very tempting. We could not tolerate all this.

85
0:07:02,240000 --> 0:07:08
And of course, we went against a very strong state, a totalitarian regime,

86
0:07:08,000000 --> 0:07:08,990000
which was trying to destroy us.

87
0:07:13,000000 --> 0:07:13,990000
This causes a lot of strong opposition.

88
0:07:16,000000 --> 0:07:16,990000
I can tell you that it is about riots, spontaneous riots,

89
0:07:22,000000 --> 0:07:22,990000
when with vans, cars, with vans, the Turks are standing, with cars, with brothers.

90
0:07:25,500000 --> 0:07:28
The Turks are looking to protect their names.

91
0:07:28,000000 --> 0:07:28,990000
And all this leads to many victims, to many victims,

92
0:07:32,000000 --> 0:07:32,990000
and to a lot of violence, to a lot of sentencing,

93
0:07:35,000000 --> 0:07:35,990000
to many suicides during the massacre, and so on.

94
0:07:38,000000 --> 0:07:38,990000
And in fact, in 1983 and 1984,

95
0:07:42,000000 --> 0:07:42,990000
there were a lot of resistance organizations and spontaneous opposition arose.

96
0:07:48,000000 --> 0:07:48,990000
This is the famous in our history, the Attentat in Bonovi, in one of the few places, which gives human victims.

97
0:07:58,000000 --> 0:07:58,990000
After which the rehabilitation process goes to a more advanced, peaceful part. This is from the beginning of 1985.

98
0:08:07,400000 --> 0:08:10,560000
It is transferred to other methods. What does this mean?

99
0:08:10,640000 --> 0:08:13,080000
This means banning speaking Turkish.

100
0:08:13,160000 --> 0:08:16
I have such regulations in my archive,

101
0:08:16,080000 --> 0:08:18,440000
such local commandments,

102
0:08:18,520000 --> 0:08:22,440000
banning the spoken languages, as they are called.

103
0:08:22,520000 --> 0:08:23,920000
The spoken languages?

104
0:08:24,000000 --> 0:08:24,990000
Yes. They enter the tombs.

105
0:08:26,000000 --> 0:08:26,990000
There are many broken tombs,

106
0:08:29,000000 --> 0:08:29,990000
inscribed with tombstones.

107
0:08:32,000000 --> 0:08:32,990000
These years, people themselves

108
0:08:35,000000 --> 0:08:35,990000
are making minarets of the women.

109
0:08:38,000000 --> 0:08:38,990000
There are more than one or two of them.

110
0:08:41,000000 --> 0:08:41,990000
It is a violence that we could not imagine.

111
0:08:44,000000 --> 0:08:44,990000
And that is still a little known, unfortunately.

112
0:08:52,760000 --> 0:08:57,240000
In 1988 I was in the village of Benkovski for a resolution.

113
0:08:57,240000 --> 0:09:02
I went there, spent a year there, I already had problems with state security,

114
0:09:02,000000 --> 0:09:02,990000
they considered that the revoluting process was in the way.

115
0:09:04,560000 --> 0:09:11,600000
I was clearly the person who spoke more, I saw how things were, this contrasted with these injustices,

116
0:09:11,600000 --> 0:09:14,800000
the information leaked and they began to get used to me.

117
0:09:14,800000 --> 0:09:16,500000
What did the locals tell you?

118
0:09:16,500000 --> 0:09:25
At that time, no one told you anything, because they were afraid, they didn't know what kind of person he is. And there are many people with their faces exposed.

119
0:09:25,000000 --> 0:09:25,990000
But in the area, the trust of the doctor who signed the death act of the Turkish girl was used.

120
0:09:33,000000 --> 0:09:33,990000
People come out, they oppose, the army, the police shoot in the air to respect the people.

121
0:09:40,000000 --> 0:09:40,990000
And by chance, when this child died that he died.

122
0:09:47,000000 --> 0:09:47,990000
He was 18 months old.

123
0:09:49,000000 --> 0:09:49,990000
Yes, he was 2 years old.

124
0:09:51,000000 --> 0:09:51,990000
What did the doctor tell you?

125
0:09:53,000000 --> 0:09:53,990000
The nurse who worked with him told me something.

126
0:09:56,000000 --> 0:09:56,990000
We told her that he was scared and was in prison because he didn't want to sign.

127
0:10:02,000000 --> 0:10:02,990000
A death act with a child, he died of a disease typical for adults.

128
0:10:08,480000 --> 0:10:15,360000
Then they took him, I guess he was used in violence, they kept him in prison in the police.

129
0:10:15,360000 --> 0:10:17,680000
Who signed the death penalty in the end?

130
0:10:17,680000 --> 0:10:19,680000
He was forced to.

131
0:10:19,680000 --> 0:10:27
Why does the communist government do all this? This is a form of national communism.

132
0:10:27,000000 --> 0:10:27,990000
Of course, the role is played here, the blockade is opposed.

133
0:10:32,000000 --> 0:10:32,990000
You have NATO, you have the Warsaw Treaty.

134
0:10:35,000000 --> 0:10:35,990000
We are on the border between NATO and the Warsaw Treaty,

135
0:10:38,000000 --> 0:10:38,990000
between Turkey and NATO.

136
0:10:40,000000 --> 0:10:40,990000
In addition, our very rebirth is a slogan to get rid of slavery,

137
0:10:50,000000 --> 0:10:50,990000
to get rid of the traitors.

138
0:10:52,000000 --> 0:10:52,990000
Who are the traitors? The Turks are the traitors.

139
0:10:54,000000 --> 0:10:54,990000
All these political and historical factors influence, of course.

140
0:11:01,000000 --> 0:11:01,990000
The totalitarian state is commanded when people are turned into impersonal puppets of a society,

141
0:11:09,000000 --> 0:11:09,990000
when everything is impersonal, so that these people can be led as one.

142
0:11:15,000000 --> 0:11:15,990000
Here I will allow myself to quote a quote from Todor Zhivkov in 1967.

143
0:11:22,000000 --> 0:11:22,990000
He says, assimilation of other people, this should not be said

144
0:11:26,000000 --> 0:11:26,990000
in a rude way, he underlines it with a smile,

145
0:11:29,000000 --> 0:11:29,990000
the assimilation is not a bad word.

146
0:11:32,000000 --> 0:11:32,990000
It depends on what sense this assimilation is made in.

147
0:11:35,000000 --> 0:11:35,990000
We, the other people, are for assimilation, including

148
0:11:38,000000 --> 0:11:38,990000
the Bulgarians, in a socialist nation.

149
0:11:42,000000 --> 0:11:42,990000
socialist nation.

150
0:11:52,000000 --> 0:11:52,990000
Here I want to add that the strong impact of the normal human relations between people in the souls of the Turks, the Plumans and the other Muslims,

151
0:11:57,000000 --> 0:11:57,990000
including the people of the Romas and all the youths,

152
0:12:01,000000 --> 0:12:01,990000
leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth.

153
0:12:04,000000 --> 0:12:04,990000
Many of them have youths, it becomes very bitter in the mouth. Many of them ask themselves the question,

154
0:12:05,600000 --> 0:12:08,700000
maybe there are individuals who have come out in our defense

155
0:12:08,700000 --> 0:12:10,700000
on the side of the Bulgarians, the ethnic Bulgarians,

156
0:12:10,700000 --> 0:12:12,700000
but we have not seen mass defense.

157
0:12:12,700000 --> 0:12:15,500000
On the contrary, many people believed in the propaganda.

158
0:12:15,500000 --> 0:12:18,500000
In a nutshell, they mixed the relationships,

159
0:12:18,500000 --> 0:12:20,800000
the normal human relationships between people.

160
0:12:20,800000 --> 0:12:22,800000
This rift in the relationship,

161
0:12:22,800000 --> 0:12:31
it gives its reflection, as a consequence, after the changes, on the basis of this, of this great wound that opens up in the Turks.

162
0:12:31,000000 --> 0:12:31,990000
This is the base on which the movement of rights was built and liberated as a subordinate with the main ethnic electorate party.

163
0:12:40,000000 --> 0:12:40,990000
All this has its consequences in the continuation of Bulgarian history.

164
0:12:46,000000 --> 0:12:46,990000
From all that has happened, unfortunately, a party, I'm not going to advertise it, often breaks the ethnic map,

165
0:12:56,000000 --> 0:12:56,990000
denies the concept that we are true defenders of the Turks in Bulgaria and continues to against Bulgarians, Muslims, Christians, always among these communities in Slovakia,

166
0:13:27,000000 --> 0:13:27,990000
the fear arises again whether they will again ask us to change our names

167
0:13:35,000000 --> 0:13:35,990000
or not to start this simulation.

168
0:13:38,000000 --> 0:13:38,990000
This is a very scary game.

169
0:13:40,000000 --> 0:13:40,990000
And no one should play with it or use it.

170
0:13:55,960000 --> 0:14:06
The events are very painful. This is an open wound that does not grow. And while Zhelyu Zhelyev, the former president, was alive, I contacted him and wanted to have a broader debate on the reproductive process.

171
0:14:06,000000 --> 0:14:06,990000
He agreed. I gathered experienced politicians, scientists and so on.

172
0:14:10,500000 --> 0:14:13
Unfortunately, Zelio Zhelev passed away.

173
0:14:13,000000 --> 0:14:13,990000
And in fact, the political circles didn't need this thing,

174
0:14:19,000000 --> 0:14:19,990000
because in the government there are people who are involved in the reproductive process

175
0:14:24,000000 --> 0:14:24,990000
and it wouldn't be nice for their names to appear.

176
0:14:31,000000 --> 0:14:31,990000
What do you know about the case?

177
0:14:34,000000 --> 0:14:34,990000
It was sabotaged from the very beginning.

178
0:14:36,000000 --> 0:14:36,990000
The whole process of restoring the truth was connected with a huge opposition

179
0:14:41,000000 --> 0:14:41,990000
from the people who felt guilty, directly or indirectly, for what had happened.

180
0:14:48,000000 --> 0:14:48,990000
The prosecution was in all the departments of the prosecution,

181
0:14:52,000000 --> 0:14:52,990000
both in the investigation department, the prosecutor's office and the court.

182
0:14:56,000000 --> 0:14:56,990000
But the court was not able to get a release.

183
0:14:59,000000 --> 0:14:59,990000
The prosecutor's office introduced a law 31 years ago, which deliberately delayed the proceedings,

184
0:15:09,600000 --> 0:15:16
because everyone who was in Belina should have come or gone to testify,

185
0:15:16,000000 --> 0:15:16,990000
even the defendants who were accused of being executed in court.

186
0:15:21,600000 --> 0:15:26
I think it was a theater or a play on democracy.

187
0:15:26,000000 --> 0:15:26,990000
The suspension of this case means that nothing that was done against the Turks, against the Pomads in Bulgaria,

188
0:15:36,000000 --> 0:15:36,990000
is not accepted for crime, at least by the judiciary. The cases that were filed for crimes against other opposition parties and other repressed ethnic Bulgarians,

189
0:15:52,000000 --> 0:15:52,990000
they also ended in such a way.

190
0:15:56,000000 --> 0:15:56,990000
The Supreme Court did not do its job and justice was not restored.

191
0:16:03,000000 --> 0:16:03,990000
and justice is not in the court.

192
0:16:09,000000 --> 0:16:09,990000
Yes, there will be no court justice. The guilty were not punished

193
0:16:11,000000 --> 0:16:11,990000
and they lived peacefully

194
0:16:13,000000 --> 0:16:13,990000
the rest of their lives.

195
0:16:16,000000 --> 0:16:16,990000
There could be some satisfaction

196
0:16:19,000000 --> 0:16:19,990000
these people could get

197
0:16:21,000000 --> 0:16:21,990000
if these things are learned

198
0:16:24,000000 --> 0:16:24,990000
from the younger generations.

199
0:16:26,000000 --> 0:16:26,990000
There should be historical memory, one should know what happened,

200
0:16:30,000000 --> 0:16:30,990000
one should know that when we talk about communism,

201
0:16:33,000000 --> 0:16:33,990000
this means a very definite human fate.

202
0:16:36,000000 --> 0:16:36,990000
One should know the stories, this also has a moral meaning.

203
0:16:41,000000 --> 0:16:41,990000
As we can see, things are very achievable.

204
0:16:44,000000 --> 0:16:44,990000
Everyone can do whatever he wants.

205
0:16:45,000000 --> 0:16:45,990000
A regime, a system can achieve a certain degree of dehumanization.

206
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
In fact, it is a matter of process of dehumanization.

207
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
If the culprits remain as culprits in history, they will get their revenge.

208
0:17:00,000000 --> 0:17:00,990000
How can this happen?

209
0:17:02,000000 --> 0:17:02,990000
If this history is studied, if historical research is done, if it enters as an organic part of Bulgarian history,

210
0:17:12,000000 --> 0:17:12,990000
and if it is taught in schools and people know about it.

211
0:17:15,000000 --> 0:17:15,990000
The Bulgarian History

212
0:17:19,000000 --> 0:17:19,990000
The Bulgarian History
