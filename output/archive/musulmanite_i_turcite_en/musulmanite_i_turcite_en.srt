The response, especially

20
0:01:11,000000 --> 0:01:11,990000
from our last two broadcasts

21
0:01:13,000000 --> 0:01:13,990000
surpasses our most bold expectations

22
0:01:16,000000 --> 0:01:16,990000
Our show already has its viewers

23
0:01:19,000000 --> 0:01:19,990000
not only in Bulgaria

24
0:01:21,000000 --> 0:01:21,990000
and among our emigration in Western Europe

25
0:01:23,000000 --> 0:01:23,990000
and America

26
0:01:24,000000 --> 0:01:24,990000
We are happy for interest interest and from the side of our fans in two neighboring countries

27
0:01:30,000000 --> 0:01:30,990000
Republic of Macedonia and Republic of Turkey.

28
0:01:33,000000 --> 0:01:33,990000
Thank you for your interest. We are sure that we will not disappoint you in the future.

29
0:01:40,000000 --> 0:01:40,990000
We will continue to touch on topics that cannot be seen on the mainstream TV.

30
0:01:47,280000 --> 0:01:53,280000
This happens only after keeping a list of guests and through controlled debate.

31
0:01:53,280000 --> 0:02:00,280000
Today we will again focus on the policy of assimilation towards the Muslims and the Turks in Bulgaria.

32
0:02:00,280000 --> 0:02:12
This time, however, we will try to look at it in a more general chronological context, from the last years under the Ottoman rule to our days.

33
0:02:12,000000 --> 0:02:12,990000
For this reason, in the second part of the story with Stefan Nechev, today I have invited the colleagues Dr. Georgi Zelengor from Sofia and Prof. Zeynep Zefer, who will be waiting for us on the line in Ankara.

34
0:02:30,000000 --> 0:02:30,990000
My first guest.

35
0:02:32,000000 --> 0:02:32,990000
Georgi Zelengor was born in 1970 in Sofia.

36
0:02:37,000000 --> 0:02:37,990000
In 1995 he finished his studies at the University of Sofia, Saint Clement Ohridski.

37
0:02:46,000000 --> 0:02:46,990000
In 2002 Georgi Zelengor was awarded a doctoral dissertation on the subject

38
0:02:53,000000 --> 0:02:53,990000
Bulgarians outside the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries.

39
0:03:01,000000 --> 0:03:01,990000
The author of the book The Pomumas in Turkey, published in 2014.

40
0:03:07,420000 --> 0:03:30
Georgi Zelengor is the producer and screen history of Bulgaria, the Balkans and Asia Minor.

41
0:03:31,000000 --> 0:03:31,990000
He has worked for various print and electronic publications.

42
0:03:36,000000 --> 0:03:36,990000
All this is the reason why I invite him to our guest today in the story with Stefan Dechev.

43
0:03:46,000000 --> 0:03:46,990000
Good afternoon, colleague Zelengor. I am glad that you will be in our show and will have the opportunity to meet our viewers, who after each next show are growing more and more.

44
0:04:17,000000 --> 0:04:17,990000
I am also glad to participate in a show where critical voices can be heard, critical opinions about history, not just propaganda clichés that the media pour on of a challenge. We give a little bit of a hint for it.

45
0:04:27,000000 --> 0:04:27,990000
What is the relationship between Christians and Muslims in today's territory,

46
0:04:33,000000 --> 0:04:33,990000
approximately in today's territory of Bulgaria,

47
0:04:37,000000 --> 0:04:37,990000
let's say in the beginning or the middle of the 70s of the 19th century,

48
0:04:43,000000 --> 0:04:43,990000
before the April uprising and before the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878.

49
0:04:50,000000 --> 0:04:50,990000
Do we have any evidence for this? Can we make some more categorical conclusions about this relationship between Christians and Muslims? There is enough statistical data, which, although not 100% accurate, are the best source for establishing the population in these territories.

50
0:05:18,000000 --> 0:05:18,990000
We have from the 1970s detailed statistics of the villages of Dunavskaya and Odrinskija.

51
0:05:29,000000 --> 0:05:29,990000
In general, there are many studies of modern demographics on the Karmakarpats, but not only that, there are many authors in foreign literature who have researched the whole document in depth.

52
0:05:47,000000 --> 0:05:47,990000
We can tell our viewers that this is a Turkish historian who has an American academic career in the United States.

53
0:05:54,000000 --> 0:05:54,990000
Yes, in America, in data are insignificant. It is important to specify the territories, exactly on which territories this measurement takes place.

54
0:06:12,800000 --> 0:06:18,800000
The Danube Vila, for example, coincides with a large part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria,

55
0:06:18,800000 --> 0:06:24
but one part of the Lower Sandzak goes to Serbia, the Northern Dobrudzha to Romania.

56
0:06:24,000000 --> 0:06:24,990000
The Odrin Vila is one hour away from Eastern Rumelia.

57
0:06:28,000000 --> 0:06:28,990000
According to these studies, the data for the Danube village show that about 41% of the population in the evening of the liberation is Muslim and about 59% is not Muslim, while the Bulgarians are a multitude, of course, a little over 50 evening of the Russian-Turkish war in the village of Dunavske are a little over 1 million.

58
0:07:11,000000 --> 0:07:11,990000
What happens to this population when the military actions begin and the Russian-Turkish war is already in its peak? 1877-1878. How did the Christian population react? How did the Muslim population react to the arrival of the region is very poor, many people die of starvation, from various epidemics that occur during the war.

59
0:07:50,000000 --> 0:07:50,990000
Now, overall, on the territory of the two regions, the Kingdom population will decrease by 50% from about 1.5 million to 750 thousand.

60
0:08:17,000000 --> 0:08:17,990000
The statistics exactly read the proportion of the data before and after the liberation.

61
0:08:27,000000 --> 0:08:27,990000
Is there such a population size, for example, Bulgarians, who from territories that remain in the Ottoman Empire,

62
0:08:33,000000 --> 0:08:33,990000
to be transferred to the future principality or Eastern Rumelia and vice versa?

63
0:08:37,000000 --> 0:08:37,990000
There is, of course, a refugee wave of Bulgarians from Macedonia, Turkey, Malaysia,

64
0:08:46,000000 --> 0:08:46,990000
also Banat and Bessarabia.

65
0:08:49,000000 --> 0:08:49,990000
But it is significantly smaller

66
0:08:52,000000 --> 0:08:52,990000
compared to the number of

67
0:08:55,000000 --> 0:08:55,990000
displaced Muslims.

68
0:08:58,000000 --> 0:08:58,990000
The population itself is decreasing sensitively.

69
0:09:01,000000 --> 0:09:01,990000
The ethnodemographic change

70
0:09:04,000000 --> 0:09:04,990000
is significant. The ethnodemographic change is substantial, comparing the Ottoman data with the first population count in Bulgaria.

71
0:09:13,500000 --> 0:09:20,500000
In the Danube village, the Muslims are already 28% according to the first population count.

72
0:09:20,500000 --> 0:09:46
So the decrease from 40% to 28% is the result of the main displacement and much smaller number of Bulgarian refugees from neighboring countries. Christians and Muslims, because among the Muslims themselves include both the Turkish population,

73
0:09:46,000000 --> 0:09:46,990000
as well as Tatars, Circassians, Pumas, who actually, since the Ottoman Empire continues to operate

74
0:09:55,000000 --> 0:09:55,990000
the system of millets, that is, the division of religions, actually this religious community has the same behavior during the war and during the advance of the Russian troops.

75
0:10:09,000000 --> 0:10:09,990000
Yes, especially for the Russian-Turkish war, the behavior of the Pomacians and the Circassians is identical.

76
0:10:16,000000 --> 0:10:16,990000
In fact, the Circassians are running around in mass numbers and almost do not remain.

77
0:10:20,000000 --> 0:10:20,990000
I think that the first count was 68 for the whole country, which is nothing.

78
0:10:28,000000 --> 0:10:28,990000
But with the palm trees, since they are in the regions of Teteven, Lukovit, Biala Slatina, about 70 villages,

79
0:10:40,000000 --> 0:10:40,990000
they are in the vicinity of Pleven, where the most serious battles are being fought.

80
0:10:48,000000 --> 0:10:48,990000
The population is subject to many requisitions and various forms of oppression and violence.

81
0:10:57,000000 --> 0:10:57,990000
Almost all the Palmatians are exiled during the Russian-Turkish war.

82
0:11:04,000000 --> 0:11:04,990000
After the war, they return for an war, after which they returned for a part of the war,

83
0:11:07,000000 --> 0:11:07,990000
but most of them stayed.

84
0:11:10,000000 --> 0:11:10,990000
As we said before, what is the correct term for the meaning of these Muslims?

85
0:11:16,000000 --> 0:11:16,990000
There is such a dispute in science,

86
0:11:19,000000 --> 0:11:19,990000
more recently, I wouldn't even say in science,

87
0:11:22,000000 --> 0:11:22,990000
there is an effort by the propagists and patriots to find another term, not just the way this population is called. The core of the plant is located in the Rhodopis Mountains, but there are also in Northern Bulgaria and in various places in Macedonia.

88
0:11:49,000000 --> 0:11:49,990000
The term of the plant is only the most common, which is used for the plants ingranates in the western and central Rhodopi,

89
0:12:05,600000 --> 0:12:07,600000
these in northern Bulgaria,

90
0:12:07,600000 --> 0:12:12,200000
the pomegranates in Tikvesh, in Maglen, in the valley of Struma,

91
0:12:12,200000 --> 0:12:15,200000
but otherwise in Macedonia, further west in Macedonia,

92
0:12:15,200000 --> 0:12:17,200000
there are known by other names,

93
0:12:17,200000 --> 0:12:20,200000
Torbeshi, Apovci, Diosyzi.

94
0:12:20,200000 --> 0:12:36
In the eastern parts of the Pomegranki Massif, the word Ahriani is preferred, even for some special areas.

95
0:12:36,000000 --> 0:12:36,990000
The word Pumaci does not cover the whole community and we use it with all its condition. It appears for the first time in the literature

96
0:12:48,000000 --> 0:12:48,990000
in the early 1940s in the newspaper

97
0:12:52,000000 --> 0:12:52,990000
of Vasil Aprilov in the newspaper of the New Bulgarian Education.

98
0:12:55,000000 --> 0:12:55,990000
You are talking about the 1940s of the 19th century.

99
0:12:57,000000 --> 0:12:57,990000
Yes, the 1941s of the 19th century.

100
0:12:59,000000 --> 0:12:59,990000
And in parallel with this, the French researcher Ami Bouet

101
0:13:03,000000 --> 0:13:03,990000
only says that he is talking about hunting The term Bulgarian-Mohamedani was first used by Mikhail Madjarov in a study, which then started by some scholars, but still the country used it for decades, mainly by Macy and only after the First World War it began to be replaced. In Turkey they call them male Turks, in Macedonia from the 70s they call them Macedonian Muslims.

102
0:13:52,000000 --> 0:13:52,990000
In the 70s there is a plenum of the Macedonian Communist Party. So all these concepts are made up of two parts.

103
0:14:07,000000 --> 0:14:07,990000
They are not naturally created, they are invented by the respective state, by its academic staff or a repressive apparatus in order to unite the population.

104
0:14:26,000000 --> 0:14:26,990000
To ease the policy of assimilation.

105
0:14:29,000000 --> 0:14:29,990000
Yes, and at the same time explain that the word POMAK is offensive,

106
0:14:33,000000 --> 0:14:33,990000
which is constantly repeated and some really start to think that it is so.

107
0:14:40,000000 --> 0:14:40,990000
What is the most impressive thing during the first census of the population after the Berlin Congress,

108
0:14:48,000000 --> 0:14:48,990000
already on the territory of the Kingdom of Bulgaria and Eastern Romania?

109
0:14:52,000000 --> 0:14:52,990000
The most impressive thing... Now, first I want to say that the Bulgarian statistics from the very beginning is on a very good level, it is consistent with a very high accuracy with the different demographic indicators.

110
0:15:09,000000 --> 0:15:09,990000
One of the reasons is that we follow the international statistical research.

111
0:15:15,000000 --> 0:15:15,990000
Absolutely. I am surprised by the high percentage of the Turkish people in Bulgaria, who was then the Director of Statistics, explains that everyone is very surprised.

112
0:15:53,000000 --> 0:15:53,990000
No one expected so much, because you know in the Renaissance seal and book are published claims for 5, 6, 7 million for the largest nation of the Balkans.

113
0:16:05,000000 --> 0:16:05,990000
At one point it turns out that this is not quite so and that a large part of the territory of Bulgaria is with a prevailing Turkish population.

114
0:16:15,000000 --> 0:16:15,990000
Yes, in fact, these 5-garization of cities are slightly exaggerated. Here we have to say to our viewers that during the fall of medieval Bulgaria, or this territory, which is today's territory of Bulgaria, several centuries, between the end of the 14th century and the middle of the 19th century.

115
0:17:13,000000 --> 0:17:13,990000
There is something else. In the 19th century, the Bulgarian population in Eastern Bulgaria was really decreasing as a relative part, due to the displacement of many Bulgariansians mainly in South Russia, in Bessarabia, as well as the displacement of refugees from Russia, Tatars, Circassians, especially in the second half.

116
0:17:37,000000 --> 0:17:37,990000
Yes, especially in the second half, especially after the Russo-Turkish wars, these processes reduced the relative share of the Bulgarian population.

117
0:17:47,000000 --> 0:17:47,990000
Here we can say that the crisis in the relations between Christians and Muslims, to a large extent,

118
0:17:54,000000 --> 0:17:54,990000
already in the 60s and 70s, was due to this newly arrived population from the southern parts of Russia, Turkey and the Circassians, and not by chance, after that, the Berlin Treaty forbids the settlement of the Circassians in the territory of the Kingdom of Bulgaria.

119
0:18:11,000000 --> 0:18:11,990000
In fact, the problem is not with the wars and such exiles, not only in Bulgaria, but also in many places in the world.

120
0:18:28,000000 --> 0:18:28,990000
And if you read carefully Christobotov, when he talks about the difficult situation of the Bulgarian people, and what needs to be a little more specific, he says

121
0:18:36,000000 --> 0:18:36,990000
Yesterday a Tatar was in the south of the Danube, yesterday a Circassian was in the south of the Danube, and so on.

122
0:18:42,000000 --> 0:18:42,990000
Yes, yes, Okay, when did the Russian-Turkish war begin, the resettlement of the Muslims from Turkey, or maybe before that, what was the attitude of the Bulgarian state towards this population after 1879-1980. Now, basically, throughout the period from the liberation to the Balkan war, we have annual whole, from the liberation, including to the end of the communist regime, the attitude towards the Turks is like a reluctance towards people who need to to move out, who are subject to relocation, that is, they treat themselves as conquerors, if we read the story, a foreign population that has to return to where it came from. The Patrigiri University of the University of Princeton, has introduced a concept called

123
0:20:06,000000 --> 0:20:06,990000
Primary Acquisition of Territory.

124
0:20:09,000000 --> 0:20:09,990000
That is, if the Proto-Bulgarians and the Slavs

125
0:20:12,000000 --> 0:20:12,990000
enter the territory of Byzantium,

126
0:20:15,000000 --> 0:20:15,990000
it is legitimate, because they inhabit their future homeland.

127
0:20:18,000000 --> 0:20:18,990000
But the Ottoman Turks should come to the Balkans.

128
0:20:21,000000 --> 0:20:21,990000
Yes, of course.

129
0:20:24,000000 --> 0:20:24,990000
Also, Bulgarian science from the very beginning,

130
0:20:28,000000 --> 0:20:28,990000
although in the interest of the society there are some sober voices,

131
0:20:35,000000 --> 0:20:35,990000
which still show concern that so many people are leaving the village and the whole territory is deserted. But they meet a lot in stories and in stories. The population is so large that it is impossible to find people from all over the world.

132
0:20:45,000000 --> 0:20:45,990000
But they meet a lot in the stories and in the manuscripts.

133
0:20:48,000000 --> 0:20:48,990000
Yes, but as a whole, the leading representatives of the historical science, and I would like to quote one of the leading historians in Bulgaria, if you allow me, a few statements from his poem,

134
0:21:05,000000 --> 0:21:05,990000
The Transfiguration of the Malaysian Bulgarians in the Principality.

135
0:21:10,000000 --> 0:21:10,990000
This is written about the settlement of the first Malaysian Bulgarians in North-East Bulgaria.

136
0:21:19,000000 --> 0:21:19,990000
And here is what he writes. There is no doubt that the fact that a large part of the local population is moving out of one country, which needs more workers to raise its welfare, is not a good sign for its future. But what does this have to do with our Turkish emigration? It is special. We have a work with a fanatical and unfriendly-minded population,

137
0:22:12,000000 --> 0:22:12,990000
which never seriously thinks about the future of the country element, no matter how bad it is for him, cannot be stopped and because on the other hand there is no hope that the remaining Turkish population, with its own cultural immobility, will be able to continue to advance with the Bulgarian population, which is quickly becoming more and more developed. nor especially to appreciate the benefit of our state from their position in Bulgaria.

138
0:23:10,000000 --> 0:23:10,990000
And as far as the territories of Northeast Bulgaria are concerned, the districts of Shumen, Varna, Razgrad and Silistra, We should not be against it, because its dense and compact Turkish population is increasingly being divided, as it is spreading with the Bulgarian.

139
0:23:32,000000 --> 0:23:32,990000
This should be in the interest of the culture, which cannot trust where the ferej is fenced with Chinese walls between the people's special relations.

140
0:23:48,000000 --> 0:23:48,990000
I'm sorry, I read it from the phone.

141
0:23:52,000000 --> 0:23:52,990000
This is a poem by Lyubomir Miletic.

142
0:23:55,000000 --> 0:23:55,990000
This is Lyubomir Miletic, after which he continues that what a graceful mood the new settlementseast of Bulgaria, the new settlements. There are some internal contradictions here.

143
0:24:07,000000 --> 0:24:07,990000
He doesn't deny that this is a bad thing for the Bulgarian economy,

144
0:24:10,000000 --> 0:24:10,990000
the very displacement.

145
0:24:12,000000 --> 0:24:12,990000
Secondly, it is really possible to argue for a long time

146
0:24:17,000000 --> 0:24:17,990000
because we know very well that at the end of the Ottoman period,

147
0:24:22,000000 --> 0:24:22,990000
as well as in the first years after the Ottoman period, already in the new Bulgarian state, the northeastern regions of Bulgaria give one of the most dynamic regions of the country, exactly these populated places.

148
0:24:47,800000 --> 0:24:52,800000
Shumen, Razgrad, Silistra, Russe and so on.

149
0:24:52,800000 --> 0:24:53,800000
Trade.

150
0:24:53,800000 --> 0:25:12
Yes, it is contrary to the claim that for this power of the revival of the Enlightenment movement, what kind of success it has achieved. The results of the counting, which include the factor of literacy, show exactly that.

151
0:25:12,000000 --> 0:25:12,990000
Let's go back to the more important solar waves between 1878 and 1912. I said that this is a period in which we have a period of settlement of many Turks, of several thousand Turks and Pomads, of course, Pomads from Northern Bulgaria, as well as from the Rodopi.

152
0:25:36,000000 --> 0:25:36,990000
For example, the Rodopi in the municipality of Chepelare, the Chepelar area, the Peshter area, the Stanimashka area, many From 70 villages, there are about 4 palm trees left and a few where there are some palm trees.

153
0:26:11,000000 --> 0:26:11,990000
Today, as a white-gold, there was half a palm tree. The numbers between 1879 and 1912 are bigger or more intense than those in the interwar period? We have the 30th anniversary of the war, which is 10,000 years, so that it does not get to very drastic and gradually the relationship changes. to find the answer. Does the desire to emigrate depend on whether we are talking about a generation that has a living memory of the rule of the Ottoman Empire or is it a question of another generation the liberation grew up in conditions where the Muslims are already a minority, they are not only from the state policy, but also from purely economic factors,

154
0:28:08,000000 --> 0:28:08,990000
because gradually there is a difference between the majority and the minority, especially in the The young Bulgarian entrepreneurship is trying to gain value in any way with their property.

155
0:28:31,000000 --> 0:28:31,990000
I can give some concrete examples with some politicians, deputies, industrialists who are getting rich very quickly for the sake of tur the Turkish and Maltese. We saw this during the big excursion.

156
0:28:47,000000 --> 0:28:47,990000
Yes, Samia says a bit, Bayganu, you lead the enemy in the Turkish villages.

157
0:28:52,000000 --> 0:28:52,990000
In general, this population was much more defenseless after the liberation of Bulgaria

158
0:28:59,000000 --> 0:28:59,990000
and it became easy to steal from such greedy capitalists, so to speak.

159
0:29:05,000000 --> 0:29:05,990000
What happened during the Balkan wars of 1912-1913?

160
0:29:11,000000 --> 0:29:11,990000
I think that what we know most is that there are new settlements and most importantly, the Bulgarian state takes the first action to change the names of the Pomats.

161
0:29:26,000000 --> 0:29:26,990000
Is this actually right or were there similar efforts before?

162
0:29:30,000000 --> 0:29:30,990000
There were ideas, that is, some of the more radical socialists in the spiritual world

163
0:29:41,000000 --> 0:29:41,990000
have thought like this for a long time, they just thought that the time had not come.

164
0:29:47,000000 --> 0:29:47,990000
And indeed, the war is always a time for such an unpunished execution of mass crimes, not only the Balkan one.

165
0:29:57,000000 --> 0:29:57,990000
Now, the Balkan war has two the front of the war operations, which is attacking the most new countries that will epidemics and of course a mass and rural wave from these territories.

166
0:30:33,000000 --> 0:30:33,990000
The other reason is, as you said, the Christianization, the campaign for the forced Christianization of the Pomac trees in Bulgaria, which causes mass dissatisfaction among the palm trees, leads to opposition, to international pressure,

167
0:30:50,000000 --> 0:30:50,990000
ultimately canceled after the war, but it is done with extreme brutality, with many victims and as a result of this, in 2013-1914, during the Palmatians, we observe the largest exodus of the Palmatians from the Rhodope and also a little from Northern Bulgaria, mainly from the Rhodope.

168
0:31:15,000000 --> 0:31:15,990000
So, in 1913-1914, between the Balkan Radoslavov came to power, after the inter-Union war, this campaign was stopped.

169
0:31:32,000000 --> 0:31:32,990000
The Muslims and the Muslims' but this is an extremely serious crime that deepens a very deep abyss.

170
0:31:47,000000 --> 0:31:47,990000
It is intended here by some extreme patriots as a communing of the Pomats,

171
0:31:53,000000 --> 0:31:53,990000
because in science it is already accepted that the Pomats are Bulgarians.

172
0:32:00,000000 --> 0:32:00,990000
In the beginning, after the liberation, I missed the first counting, counting as Turks.

173
0:32:06,000000 --> 0:32:06,990000
After that they start as Pomacians, until 1926, and then they are considered as Bulgarians.

174
0:32:12,000000 --> 0:32:12,990000
The ordinary Bulgarian population, how does it perceive them from 1879 to the wars? How the local population perceives the pomacites. Now, I think that on a daily level people have always understood each other, communicated until the moment when the other's interest is not interfered with, the state. I am the author of a documentary film.

175
0:32:45,000000 --> 0:32:45,990000
The exhumation of the tombs from the village of Orehovo in the case is a major part of the two souls, but it deepens the gap between the population, between Christians and Muslims. So, this is valid now and always happens.

176
0:33:07,000000 --> 0:33:07,990000
The three years later, in 1896. Exactly. Stoyil Shishkov was a teacher at that time in Orehovo,

177
0:33:27,000000 --> 0:33:27,990000
where two thirds of the residents were Pomacians, one third Christians.

178
0:33:31,000000 --> 0:33:31,990000
And he, because he showed sympathy for the Pomacians

179
0:33:36,000000 --> 0:33:36,990000
and sympathized with this exhumation, wrote this story, which...

180
0:33:40,000000 --> 0:33:40,990000
It is encouraging.

181
0:33:42,000000 --> 0:33:42,990000
Yes, which later served as the basis for the documentary film.

182
0:33:50,000000 --> 0:33:50,990000
We will have the opportunity to see a response from him. There are some appetites for the property, they start in the place of the most conservative and moderate parties in Bulgaria,

183
0:34:30,000000 --> 0:34:30,990000
as the National Party, and despite everything, it is possible to achieve such actions.

184
0:34:34,000000 --> 0:34:34,990000
There are better specialists who have been working on this issue say that this is more of a matter of irresponsible factors.

185
0:34:48,000000 --> 0:34:48,990000
The state preserves a small-mindedness of the population.

186
0:34:51,000000 --> 0:34:51,990000
It just does not prevent it.

187
0:34:53,000000 --> 0:34:53,990000
It does not prevent it, that is, it supports it, but it does not interfere.

188
0:34:57,000000 --> 0:34:57,990000
Only Mikhail Takiyev, who comes out of the Democratic Party with a letter in which has declared itself against this with purely constitutional arguments.

189
0:35:09,000000 --> 0:35:09,990000
It is enough to have an elementary legal culture to make it clear that what is done is wrong.

190
0:35:15,000000 --> 0:35:15,990000
Yes, but in general there is a great unity between the local community, the clergy and the Macedonian and Thracian priests on the question that this is the most appropriate moment for this.

191
0:35:28,000000 --> 0:35:28,990000
Of course, we have to note the fact that this behavior of the party of all those who participate in it and a complete lack of knowledge of the state.

192
0:35:58,000000 --> 0:35:58,990000
At one point the First World War comes and Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire are allies together with the Central Powers, Germany and Austro-Hungary.

193
0:36:08,000000 --> 0:36:08,990000
What is the behavior of the Bulgarian state and, more specifically, what is the behavior of the Muslim and Turkish population in the country, when Bulgaria and Turkey are allies, all the treaties, the Tsarist Treaty, after the 15th anniversary of the agreement,

194
0:36:28,000000 --> 0:36:28,990000
force Bulgaria to read the rights of the Muslims and to take some measures to avoid serious conflicts and conflicts. At that moment, however, the Bulgarian state

195
0:36:46,000000 --> 0:36:46,990000
again finds a way to free itself from part of the

196
0:36:49,000000 --> 0:36:49,990000
Muslims, sending a huge

197
0:36:52,000000 --> 0:36:52,990000
number of tens of thousands of young

198
0:36:55,000000 --> 0:36:55,990000
Muslims to serve in the Turkish army,

199
0:36:58,000000 --> 0:36:58,990000
handing them over to Turkey, which is a mutual agreement.

200
0:37:01,000000 --> 0:37:01,990000
Turkey

201
0:37:04,000000 --> 0:37:04,990000
fights on much heavier fronts and giving much more victims.

202
0:37:08,000000 --> 0:37:08,990000
I remember the Saturday evening of the Balkan war when Ferdinand declared the war as a war of the cross in half a month.

203
0:37:17,000000 --> 0:37:17,990000
There were objections from Western European countries, including them.

204
0:37:21,000000 --> 0:37:21,990000
They said, why should you declare it as a religious war when you are talking about the rights?

205
0:37:26,000000 --> 0:37:26,990000
Exactly. Even more so, that in Bulgaria we have 14% of Muslims in the Balkan war.

206
0:37:32,000000 --> 0:37:32,990000
So, from Russian to Turkish they have decreased from 28% to 14%, but this is still a significant minority.

207
0:37:39,000000 --> 0:37:39,990000
There is also a report by Atanas Shopov that the territories that Bulgaria claims to be in the evening of the war count the palm trees for Bulgaria after the Krastilka, this is really...

208
0:38:15,000000 --> 0:38:15,990000
In this context, they need a lot of effort to be counted in this way. Yes, exactly. And generally speaking, the country is expanding with such territories.

209
0:38:30,400000 --> 0:38:36,720000
But on this issue, especially for the Muslims, there is a lot of controversy among the generals themselves.

210
0:38:36,720000 --> 0:39:29
On the one hand, they think that too many Muslims in the Bulgarian army is not good for the discipline and they send mass diplomats and Turks mainly from the new lands, because these old ones have Bulgarian citizenship, and these new ones have the right, if they wish, because Turkey sent a large part of them to the Balkan fronts and this was a danger.

211
0:39:29,000000 --> 0:39:29,990000
In general, in the end, many people die.

212
0:39:34,000000 --> 0:39:34,990000
Many Muslims in the Caucasus, First and the Second World Wars? Yes, and in parallel with this, in Turkey, there is still a war going on, before Atatürk's victory, before the revolution.

213
0:40:11,000000 --> 0:40:11,990000
The situation there is uncertain, and we even have examples of the return of the Palmatians, especially from Turkey. that the more traditionalist-like Muslim population, including those from Bulgaria,

214
0:40:25,000000 --> 0:40:25,990000
is suspected of the politics of Atatürk himself?

215
0:40:29,000000 --> 0:40:29,990000
Or is there such a contradiction?

216
0:40:31,000000 --> 0:40:31,990000
On the contrary, I think that in principle here more observers notice that in Bulgaria

217
0:40:37,000000 --> 0:40:37,990000
Atatürk is used among the Muslims with a very big authority, they follow the events very closely and support their actions.

218
0:40:50,000000 --> 0:40:50,990000
Should it be said that the Muslims have grown in contact with Christians in the environment, closer Asia Minor have grown in such a way as the opposite.

219
0:41:06,000000 --> 0:41:06,990000
But all this changed in 1923, when a more revanchist government came to Bulgaria as a result of visas for thousands of people annually.

220
0:41:28,000000 --> 0:41:28,990000
However, the visas have a significant change.

221
0:41:32,000000 --> 0:41:32,990000
The visas in Turkey are banned.

222
0:41:35,000000 --> 0:41:35,990000
They are already recognized as Bulgarians.

223
0:41:38,000000 --> 0:41:38,990000
The state already looks at them as Bulgarians. It begins to open schools in the villages of Pomashki, which, of course, causes a reaction among the people.

224
0:41:55,000000 --> 0:41:55,990000
Not only schools, but all kinds of state services in the area. For example, there is a case in Zlatograd, where a local doctor in 1934 had a campaign against the vyshki, he beat naked women and burned their clothes, and this caused a very sharp reaction and mass illegal running. The Pomads started to flee illegally during this period, because it was already illegal.

225
0:42:26,000000 --> 0:42:26,990000
This is a similar Pomad, Mehmet Kundiov, from the village, they run illegally through the border

226
0:42:45,940000 --> 0:42:48,700000
and settle in the mountainous area

227
0:42:48,700000 --> 0:42:51,660000
east of Samsun, the black and white area.

228
0:42:51,660000 --> 0:42:54,660000
They run through Turkey or through Greece?

229
0:42:54,660000 --> 0:42:57,540000
They run through Greece, all illegal runs are through

230
0:42:57,540000 --> 0:43:00,540000
Greece on the Pumatii and from there through the Turkish consul

231
0:43:00,540000 --> 0:43:03,500000
in Gümürcün, he sends them with the Turkish

232
0:43:03,500000 --> 0:43:09
railways to Turkey and from there the village commissions distributed them.

233
0:43:09,000000 --> 0:43:09,990000
But in 1900 there were many deaths, especially after the Democratic Party, issued a decree in March that many refugees from the village of Dolene, a group of 27, 12 of which weres, when the construction of more serious borders began.

234
0:44:12,000000 --> 0:44:12,990000
During this period, the so-called friendship-relationship appeared. What can you say about this phenomenon?

235
0:44:46,000000 --> 0:44:46,990000
Evgenia Ivanova is more failed for the integration of this population.

236
0:44:53,000000 --> 0:44:53,990000
And some people then recommend that this process of the donations of a donor elite be left,

237
0:45:00,000000 --> 0:45:00,990000
that an organization be created that be supported by the state.

238
0:45:05,000000 --> 0:45:05,990000
And so in 1937 the Druzhba Rodina was created, which, although it managed to create some structures in the area,

239
0:45:14,000000 --> 0:45:14,990000
in general, it was used with absolutely... it immediately attracted the negative attitude of the diplomats themselves. You know that after the National Assembly announced a fascist organization...

240
0:45:29,000000 --> 0:45:29,990000
What happened after September 9, 1944?

241
0:45:34,000000 --> 0:45:34,990000
The settlement process after September 9, unlike the one before that,

242
0:45:41,000000 --> 0:45:41,990000
is, as I said a campaign. We have three big waves. 50-51, then 68-1 and then the so-called big excursion 89.

243
0:45:57,000000 --> 0:45:57,990000
In the first years there are some cheats. What would you say? These Cheti helpers are defined as part of the Goran movement.

244
0:46:06,000000 --> 0:46:06,990000
In the Pirin region there are many points of contact with the Pirin people.

245
0:46:13,000000 --> 0:46:13,990000
So, they are opposed to the communist collectivization?

246
0:46:16,000000 --> 0:46:16,990000
They are opposed to the mobilization after September 9th for the war against Germany.

247
0:46:24,000000 --> 0:46:24,990000
Many people ran away from the mobilization and formed Cheti. September 9th for the war against Germany.

248
0:46:25,000000 --> 0:46:25,990000
There are many who run away from the mobilization, they form a group of 4.

249
0:46:29,000000 --> 0:46:29,990000
Subsequently, these 4 are generally taken along the entire border, but mostly in the Gotse-Delchevsky district.

250
0:46:35,000000 --> 0:46:35,990000
There are some quite large groups, such as Parcho, Fai Gaziev and some other Chetis, who help the local part of the population inites are settled in various parts of North-East Bulgaria, in places that were emptied by the Turks in the 1950s.

251
0:47:15,000000 --> 0:47:15,990000
We have a large internal settlement and they still live today. There is a market, a shopping mall, a town, a town hall,lak, Burgas in these areas. And what is the participation of the Pumacites in these settlements that take place after September 9?

252
0:47:29,000000 --> 0:47:29,990000
From 1950 to 1980.

253
0:47:32,000000 --> 0:47:32,990000
In principle, the ban on Pumacites continues to apply. The state does not allow the settlement of Pumacites.

254
0:47:39,000000 --> 0:47:39,990000
In addition to those who in the 1940s managed to escape in this period of uncertainty, in the following periods there are some attempts by the Pumacians who are settled in the Turkish villages to learn Turkish and try to present themselves as Turks to get an easy passport, an international passport to emigrate.

255
0:48:08,000000 --> 0:48:08,990000
Now there are examples of escape, but they are very few.

256
0:48:13,000000 --> 0:48:13,990000
For example, a group of young people from the village of Godse Delchevsko in 1972 managed to escape three or four times.

257
0:48:23,000000 --> 0:48:23,990000
I met one of them, they were 19 years old at the time.

258
0:48:28,000000 --> 0:48:28,990000
They are currently in different regions of Turkey, but they gather and make their own daily collections.

259
0:48:35,000000 --> 0:48:35,990000
They are in the state security documents. There are documents for their escape. but 15 out of 20 people manage to escape.

260
0:48:48,000000 --> 0:48:48,990000
There are some, but not all, but not the most.

261
0:48:53,000000 --> 0:48:53,990000
Following all these events from 1879 to the Balkan Wars, between the First and Second World Wars, the wave after September 9, 1944.

262
0:49:06,160000 --> 0:49:14,240000
How do you see the last major exodus from 1989 with the rest?

263
0:49:14,240000 --> 0:49:16,240000
What is the largest, the largest?

264
0:49:16,240000 --> 0:49:22
The largest exodus is undoubtedly the first one during the Russian-Turkish war.

265
0:49:22,000000 --> 0:49:22,990000
This is maybe the second one, which the number here can be from 310 to 360 thousand.

266
0:49:28,000000 --> 0:49:28,990000
This is depending on the period.

267
0:49:30,000000 --> 0:49:30,990000
You are talking about all the Muslims here.

268
0:49:32,000000 --> 0:49:32,990000
The Pomacians, the Turks and so on.

269
0:49:34,000000 --> 0:49:34,990000
Yes. The last wave of the Pomacians is in the year 1990.

270
0:49:39,000000 --> 0:49:39,990000
Inep Zafer can talk more about this, about these villages that were destroyed in 1973.

271
0:49:49,440000 --> 0:49:56,880000
After they restored their names, they moved to Turkey, a large group.

272
0:49:56,880000 --> 0:50:15
Otherwise, this is the second largest. The Balkan war is about 413,000 refugees in Turkey, of which a little more than half are from Bulgaria, the others are from the rest of Serbia, Greece and Montenegro.

273
0:50:15,000000 --> 0:50:15,990000
So this is the second major settlement. Unlike the others, this is a settlement in a peaceful time.

274
0:50:23,000000 --> 0:50:23,990000
You say Serbia and Montenegro, do you include Bosnia here?

275
0:50:26,200000 --> 0:50:38,200000
Bosnia at that time is the present Bosnia in the composition of Austro-Hungary, but Montenegro also acquires some territories inhabited there in the region.

276
0:50:38,200000 --> 0:50:45
There are also many refugees in Turkey who have their own villages.

277
0:50:45,000000 --> 0:50:45,990000
Okay, when you gather all these waves, can we say for a period of over 100 years, what is the total number of the displaced Turks and Muslims from the territory of today's Bulgaria, from the Balkans? So, there are enough studies and experiments on this issue.

278
0:51:06,320000 --> 0:51:09,680000
This is what happens, of course, when the data is summed up,

279
0:51:09,680000 --> 0:51:20,800000
we get a figure of over 1,700,000 for 100 years, 120 years or so.

280
0:51:20,800000 --> 0:52:07
Of course, these people in Turkey, there was a study where for the origin, because Turkey is a country of refugees with a very large percentage of refugees, The number of those who come from Bulgaria is very high and by this indicator Bulgaria is the largest donor of the population compared to the Balkan countries, only from Russia, but the process is long there, and Russia is big there.

281
0:52:07,000000 --> 0:52:07,990000
It starts with Peter I, Russia is still big for a small country like Bulgaria.

282
0:52:16,000000 --> 0:52:16,990000
Is the reason for this the greater proximity of Bulgaria to Turkey or is there a specificity of the Bulgarian politics? This is the result of this politics and the Bulgarian politics.

283
0:52:29,000000 --> 0:52:29,990000
Closeness certainly matters, but compared to other Balkan countries, the percentage of the Muslim population is a little higher. Have you made an attempt to calculate the balance of the Bulgarians who came from the Ottoman Empire,

284
0:52:50,500000 --> 0:52:57,500000
settled in Bulgaria, and the Turks and Muslims who were exiled from Bulgaria to Turkey?

285
0:52:57,500000 --> 0:53:07
I have been dealing a lot with the Bulgarian refugees refugees, more specifically with Malaysian Bulgarians, on whom I had my dissertation.

286
0:53:07,000000 --> 0:53:07,990000
I have visited their villages, most of which are now inhabited by the Pomacians, while others are from other villages in Bulgaria. where Bulgaria has received significantly more refugees than it has expelled foreign population, especially from Greece, because there were no Serbs to be expelled to Serbia. The balance is quite in the hands of Bulgaria. I said here about 1,700,000 for 100 years.

287
0:53:47,000000 --> 0:53:47,990000
For the same period, the Bulgarian refugees from the territory of today's Turkey are about 140,000 to 150,000.

288
0:53:57,000000 --> 0:53:57,990000
I am talking about today's Turkey, because...

289
0:54:00,000000 --> 0:54:00,990000
If we are talking about the Ottoman Empire, the end of the the Ottoman Empire, the number of Bulgarian refugees is significantly smaller than when you go to the west of Turkey, where you meet people from Bulgaria in every village.

290
0:54:21,000000 --> 0:54:21,990000
We don't stay with such impressions as reading the pathos of our literature for the national association.

291
0:54:27,000000 --> 0:54:27,990000
Unfortunately, the academic mediocrity continues to be based on the contributions of Vasil Kanchov. I have followed his steps in Asia Minor and I can say how conscientiously he has been, but both in Asia Minor and Macedonia he has driven Bulgarians twice as far as they are. and the economic mediocrity, despite the fact that so many statistics have been published and so many studies have been conducted,

292
0:55:07,000000 --> 0:55:07,990000
continue to be based on the contribution of Vasil Kanchov.

293
0:55:10,000000 --> 0:55:10,990000
Vasil Kanchov is not the one who misuses the has, because he counts Bulgarians based on the language he speaks.

294
0:55:35,000000 --> 0:55:35,990000
If he is a patriarch and a standard, we need to count him again for Bulgarians. who mainly gives Christians and Muslims, but now Vasil Kanchov still has some excuse,

295
0:55:48,680000 --> 0:55:54,840000
because at the time the science was not yet enough to include so much data in the circulation.

296
0:55:54,840000 --> 0:56:11
But the modern authors, the modern university researchers simply have no excuse to continue using the statistics of Kanchov for Macedonia or Miletic for Thrace.

297
0:56:11,000000 --> 0:56:11,990000
I would like to give an example of Kanchov's methodology. If I may quote a few lines, he decides here, according to the houses, to estimate the population.

298
0:56:29,000000 --> 0:56:29,990000
And now he says, for the estimate of the population, we have toured everywhere for the Mohamedan Turks, five people living in the house.

299
0:56:43,000000 --> 0:56:43,990000
And he explains, usually the Turkish families are usually small because they do not have enough children.

300
0:56:48,000000 --> 0:56:48,990000
The gypsies and Jews have to be estimated at 6-6.5%.

301
0:57:01,000000 --> 0:57:01,990000
The Bulgarian population is more fertile with children, the the rural population, which is a very small percentage, and 6-7% and somewhere more for the rural population.

302
0:57:28,000000 --> 0:57:28,990000
This is the way in which he uses the data from the Ottoman Salon Meta, but he explains everywhere that here the Turkish statistics do not match our data, they magnify the number of Muslims and reduce the number of Christians.

303
0:57:49,240000 --> 0:58:11
Miletic in the same way, but they, as in Macedonia, so in Asia Minor, he visits mainly some cities, including small towns, from there he collects information about the whole area. Here came some of the Zanayachis, Abadji, some of the sheep, this village, he told him that there are so many houses in this village.

304
0:58:11,000000 --> 0:58:11,990000
And basically, this is the same with Miletic, them and, despite that, gives a much higher figure.

305
0:58:34,020000 --> 0:58:45
And besides that, he criticizes Karayov for putting the Pumas to the Turks, not to the Bulgarians.

306
0:58:45,000000 --> 0:58:45,990000
And yet, unlike the Bulgarian historical science,

307
0:58:48,000000 --> 0:58:48,990000
humanities, ethnography, folklore from the late 50s to the late 80s,

308
0:58:54,000000 --> 0:58:54,990000
and again by inertia in the 90s,

309
0:58:57,000000 --> 0:58:57,990000
they did not participate in the ideological establishment of the change of names,

310
0:59:03,000000 --> 0:59:03,990000
as this happened then, according to the Pumacites from the beginning of the 70s,

311
0:59:10,000000 --> 0:59:10,990000
72-73, the change of the names of the Turks in 84-85, where we see that the Faculty of History,

312
0:59:22,000000 --> 0:59:22,990000
the Faculty of History of Bulgaria, the University of Sofia, the Institute of History of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences have an exceptional work of art.

313
0:59:32,000000 --> 0:59:32,990000
I would like to end, since you are the author of the book about the Pomads in Turkey, to tell us, maybe to show it to our viewers, how many Pomads are in Turkey today? Where do they live and what is their identity?

314
0:59:47,000000 --> 0:59:47,990000
I mentioned the total number of the settlements.

315
0:59:53,000000 --> 0:59:53,990000
With the Pomacians, the old borders of the United Bulgaria can be established.

316
1:00:01,000000 --> 1:00:01,990000
For the new lands, there are some difficulties in establishing, but in general it can be said that the number and Kostorskite palm trees, which as a exchange of take into account some reproduction at a medium-year rate for that time, It would be necessary for about half a million people to live in Turkey today.

317
1:01:07,000000 --> 1:01:07,990000
The people of Pomaç are on the market.

318
1:01:09,000000 --> 1:01:09,990000
Of course, how many of them think of Pomaç is another matter.

319
1:01:14,000000 --> 1:01:14,990000
You are the film director for Pomaç in Turkey.

320
1:01:16,000000 --> 1:01:16,990000
Maybe we can see a reaction from him.

321
1:01:18,000000 --> 1:01:18,990000
I would like to say something about Pomaç in Turkey.

322
1:01:21,000000 --> 1:01:21,990000
I have established about 250 villages in Turkey.

323
1:01:27,000000 --> 1:01:27,990000
Half of them are in European Turkey, a little more than half in Asian.

324
1:01:33,000000 --> 1:01:33,990000
After publishing the book, I have established about 10.

325
1:01:38,000000 --> 1:01:38,990000
The presence of the local towns, the surrounding centers is also very strong, so especially in Thrace and in the northwest of Asia Minor, as well as some enclave in Izmir, Samson, Eskişehir, we have a very compact population.

326
1:02:02,000000 --> 1:02:02,990000
Do you keep in mind your grandparents from Bulgaria? Of course.

327
1:02:06,000000 --> 1:02:06,990000
Especially in recent years, with the emergence of the Internet and social networks,

328
1:02:11,000000 --> 1:02:11,990000
many lost family ties have begun to be restored,

329
1:02:17,000000 --> 1:02:17,990000
in which I have also participated.

330
1:02:19,000000 --> 1:02:19,990000
I have found many people, the relatives, who they considered to be irreversible,

331
1:02:25,000000 --> 1:02:25,990000
drowned in, disappeared and some connections were restored,

332
1:02:31,000000 --> 1:02:31,990000
which have long been interrupted, because especially during the period of communism

333
1:02:36,000000 --> 1:02:36,990000
it was almost impossible to...

334
1:02:40,000000 --> 1:02:40,990000
Yes, in the conditions of the Cold War.

335
1:02:42,000000 --> 1:02:42,990000
Yes, in the conditions of the Cold War.

336
1:02:44,000000 --> 1:02:44,990000
Let's see a clip from the movie.

337
1:02:45,000000 --> 1:02:45,990000
Okay, yes.

338
1:02:46,000000 --> 1:02:46,990000
With pleasure.

339
1:03:27,000000 --> 1:03:27,990000
On the east of the Dardanelles, deep in the mountain ranges of northwestern Asia, but they forcibly left their native fires in the Rhodope.

340
1:04:28,440000 --> 1:04:46
This is how the village Ilias Agachev Lik was born. It's a conflict. We will help you! The village of Krasnoyars of Chiflik The village of Chiflik

341
1:04:46,000000 --> 1:04:46,990000
The village of Chiflik

342
1:04:48,000000 --> 1:04:48,990000
The village of Chiflik

343
1:04:50,000000 --> 1:04:50,990000
The village of Chiflik

344
1:04:52,000000 --> 1:04:52,990000
In Ilyas Agachiflik there are a few people left, mostly elderly.

345
1:04:57,000000 --> 1:04:57,990000
Most of its inhabitants have fled through the cities of Cham, Biga, Chanakale, Istanbul,

346
1:05:03,000000 --> 1:05:03,990000
and some have left for have gone to Europe.

347
1:05:08,000000 --> 1:05:08,990000
That's why every spring the village gathers its scattered treasures to remind them where they started.

348
1:05:20,000000 --> 1:05:20,990000
Would you say, at the end of our show, you have been on the ground many times in Turkey. What are the things that when I started the field work I had no relationship by the presence of many small villages that have moved out of their generation and still speak their mother tongue.

349
1:06:14,000000 --> 1:06:14,990000
Of course, those who have already settledern Asia, language is not only spoken, but it is also used in daily communication between the neighbors. The women are among themselves, from the neighboring villages.

350
1:06:45,000000 --> 1:06:45,990000
Of course, there is already a process of dehumanization, but there is still some form fates, following the settlement.

351
1:07:12,000000 --> 1:07:12,990000
I have come across various examples of identity of people from different generations, The younger generations that have experienced violence, they have some kind of negativity towards Bulgaria.

352
1:07:31,000000 --> 1:07:31,990000
The older generations do not have any.

353
1:07:33,000000 --> 1:07:33,990000
The fourth and fifth generations, on the contrary, have an interest and desire for communication, which has happened in practice in the last two decades.

354
1:07:43,000000 --> 1:07:43,990000
They often go to the Rhodopita,

355
1:07:46,000000 --> 1:07:46,990000
there are many palm trees in this area.

356
1:07:49,000000 --> 1:07:49,990000
This is an interesting phenomenon

357
1:07:52,000000 --> 1:07:52,990000
which I think that the palm trees

358
1:07:55,000000 --> 1:07:55,990000
are a small number of species.

359
1:07:58,000000 --> 1:07:58,990000
They have no chance

360
1:08:01,000000 --> 1:08:01,990000
to lead some kind of independent

361
1:08:04,000000 --> 1:08:04,990000
isolated existence, but they could turn into a bridge, a cultural bridge between the Balkan countries.

362
1:08:14,000000 --> 1:08:14,990000
Not only Bulgaria and Turkey, but also Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, Albania. And of course, the politicians have to realize how valuable this is, because this is one of the great pillars of the Bulgarian diaspora, if we are honest.

363
1:08:34,440000 --> 1:09:05
I would say they are more than the non-Arabian Bulgarians. especially for the This is what I witnessed.

364
1:09:05,000000 --> 1:09:05,990000
Dr. Zelengora, thank you for your participation today. This was the end of the first part of the story with Stefan Dechev. See you soon.

365
1:09:17,000000 --> 1:09:17,990000
Hello again. As I promised you previously, in the second part of the story with Stefan Dechev with Professor Zeynep Zefer.

366
1:09:27,000000 --> 1:09:27,990000
She was born in 1958 in the village of Kornitsa, Blagoevgradsko.

367
1:09:33,000000 --> 1:09:33,990000
In 1973, during the violent change of the names of the Pumats in Bulgaria, Zeynep was evicted together with her parents, opposing the assimilatory policy of the communist regime.

368
1:09:48,640000 --> 1:09:56,720000
The subsequent forceful change of name in 1982 refused to change its name.

369
1:09:56,720000 --> 1:10:07,240000
It was forced by the state security agencies to suspend its investigation into the Higher Pedagogical Institute Schumann, a specialization in Bulgarian

370
1:10:07,240000 --> 1:10:08,240000
theology.

371
1:10:08,240000 --> 1:10:18,960000
During the largest wave of assimilation in 1985, he was sentenced to two years in prison,

372
1:10:18,960000 --> 1:10:32
two years in prison and a monetary prison. In 1988, Zeynep Zafer is in the group of the first Turkish members of the Independent Society

373
1:10:32,000000 --> 1:10:32,990000
for Human Rights, led by Ilya Minev.

374
1:10:36,000000 --> 1:10:36,990000
He is a representative of the Association for the Varna Region.

375
1:10:40,000000 --> 1:10:40,990000
He is included in the staffet hunger strike in support of the writer Peter Menolov, Secretary of the Independent Society for Human Rights.

376
1:10:52,000000 --> 1:10:52,990000
Zeynep Zefer was among the group of dissidents determined to meet with the French President François Mitterrand at his visit to Bulgaria in January 1989.

377
1:11:06,000000 --> 1:11:06,990000
Participation was then also delayed because it was detained by the militia.

378
1:11:12,000000 --> 1:11:12,990000
Zeynep Sefer actively participated in the construction among the Turks in northeastern Bulgaria

379
1:11:19,000000 --> 1:11:19,990000
of the structures of the Independent Society for the Protection of Human Rights, which prepare and lead the May events in 1989.

380
1:11:31,000000 --> 1:11:31,990000
Mass protests among the Turkish population against the assimilation policy,

381
1:11:38,000000 --> 1:11:38,990000
cynically called the reviving process.

382
1:11:41,000000 --> 1:11:41,990000
On February 3, 1989, she was expelled from the country.

383
1:11:49,000000 --> 1:11:49,990000
Only three years after the changes in 1989, Zeynep Zefer managed to graduate.

384
1:11:57,000000 --> 1:11:57,990000
She works at the Ankara Universityology at the University, and after 2000 he was

385
1:12:07,000000 --> 1:12:07,990000
the head of the Department of Bulgarian Language and Literature.

386
1:12:12,000000 --> 1:12:12,990000
He participated in many international scientific manifestations.

387
1:12:17,000000 --> 1:12:17,990000
He is the author of a number of articles on Russian and Bulgarian literature, the theory and practice of the artistic translation from Russian and Bulgarian to Turkish.

388
1:12:36,000000 --> 1:12:36,990000
Zeynep Zefer is also the author of books, among which are Chekhov as a Master of Story, Nov new reading of Ivan Vazov and others.

389
1:12:48,000000 --> 1:12:48,990000
I am convinced that in the already well-documented policy of the Bulgarian state

390
1:12:55,000000 --> 1:12:55,990000
from the communist period for the assimilation of the Turks and Muslims in Bulgaria,

391
1:13:01,000000 --> 1:13:01,990000
related to the order of acts on the change of names, as well as with the

392
1:13:05,000000 --> 1:13:05,990000
attempt to clean up ethnically from 1989, still continue to be missing the voices of

393
1:13:13,000000 --> 1:13:13,990000
the Bulgarian Muslims and Turks themselves.

394
1:13:17,000000 --> 1:13:17,990000
That is why today I decided to present one of my guests to be a professor for ENEP ZFR, whom I welcome with a welcome to the history with Stefan Dechev and I welcome her, she is in her home in Ankara.

395
1:13:38,000000 --> 1:13:38,990000
Thank you, Mr. Dechev.

396
1:14:08,000000 --> 1:14:08,990000
Could you tell our viewers something more about yourself, your early childhood, they have a basic education, that is, they have a completed education, until seventh grade. I have heard from two of my grandmothers that in 2012 the people who were forced to flee and reach the Aegean Sea, to go down to Anatolia. But this problem started to interest me more after 1964,

397
1:14:54,000000 --> 1:14:54,990000
when I was actually 6 years old,

398
1:14:58,560000 --> 1:15:03,520000
I witnessed the first experience

399
1:15:03,520000 --> 1:15:13
of the name change, of the promotion of the first attempt to name the Bulgarians during this period or during the 1960s.

400
1:15:13,000000 --> 1:15:13,990000
Actually, I had heard from my grandmother, who is from Palatik,

401
1:15:20,000000 --> 1:15:20,990000
and who, returning from the White Sea, could not reach their native place,

402
1:15:27,000000 --> 1:15:27,990000
they settled in the village of Kornitsa,

403
1:15:31,000000 --> 1:15:31,990000
and they were given shelter in the village's mosque.

404
1:15:37,000000 --> 1:15:37,990000
How the Pope and Popeess also lived in the mosque,

405
1:15:42,000000 --> 1:15:42,990000
and other civil servants, who in of 2012 started to change their names or call the population of the village Kornuta.

406
1:15:58,000000 --> 1:15:58,990000
This is during the crusade, during the Balkan war, which we War with Dr. Zelen Gora a while ago. Yes, yes, yes.

407
1:16:06,000000 --> 1:16:06,990000
She remembers, she was 6 years old, 7 years old after returning from there, 6 months passed.

408
1:16:13,000000 --> 1:16:13,990000
She told me that this lasted 6 months.

409
1:16:17,000000 --> 1:16:17,990000
And when 1964 started again, by the way, the men had fled the forest, there was a lot of snow, but somehow we believed that what happened in 2012 would happen again in 1964 and something would happen again. to be Bulgarians. By the way, I am six years older than my brother,

410
1:16:46,000000 --> 1:16:46,990000
he is two and a half years younger than me.

411
1:16:49,000000 --> 1:16:49,990000
I was sent from my mother to her mother

412
1:16:53,000000 --> 1:16:53,990000
to make the connection between the two families,

413
1:16:57,000000 --> 1:16:57,990000
because only the women remained in the two families.

414
1:17:01,000000 --> 1:17:01,990000
From time to time I saw policemen or people from the commission, they had to be from the, because I didn't know them, who were holding people in the council.

415
1:17:13,000000 --> 1:17:13,990000
I went back home and talked about these things. when everything passed and when people went out on the street and started celebrating the fact that the names would not be changed,

416
1:17:32,000000 --> 1:17:32,990000
that something had happened again and this policy had not succeeded.

417
1:17:37,000000 --> 1:17:37,990000
So after that period, from 1964 onwards, I really started to be more interested in life.

418
1:17:45,000000 --> 1:17:45,990000
And my two grandmothers, my mother's mother was 10 years old, my father's mother was 6 years old,

419
1:17:52,000000 --> 1:17:52,990000
and my two grandmothers with their family went on a walk, I have already said, to Greece now,

420
1:18:01,000000 --> 1:18:01,990000
and they returned to the path of what had happened, of the murder, of the killing in the village of Kornica,

421
1:18:07,000000 --> 1:18:07,990000
of the rape and of everything that had happened

422
1:18:10,000000 --> 1:18:10,990000
in the 12-13 years.

423
1:18:13,000000 --> 1:18:13,990000
And Barli told me that after 6 years

424
1:18:15,000000 --> 1:18:15,990000
all of this collapsed and we returned again

425
1:18:20,000000 --> 1:18:20,990000
to the religion and the names.

426
1:18:22,000000 --> 1:18:22,990000
The year 1964 actually 1964 lasted several days,

427
1:18:26,000000 --> 1:18:26,990000
at least I remember.

428
1:18:28,000000 --> 1:18:28,990000
But then everything was released again,

429
1:18:31,000000 --> 1:18:31,990000
weddings and funerals began to take place freely.

430
1:18:34,000000 --> 1:18:34,990000
We were really happy.

431
1:18:37,000000 --> 1:18:37,990000
How did you explain to yourself

432
1:18:40,000000 --> 1:18:40,990000
that the attempt to change the names had passed?

433
1:18:43,000000 --> 1:18:43,990000
What did you give it back then? Or at least the elderly?

434
1:18:47,000000 --> 1:18:47,990000
The religious people believed that Allah had helped them,

435
1:18:52,000000 --> 1:18:52,990000
while others thought that the reason was the protest in Ribnovo,

436
1:18:58,000000 --> 1:18:58,990000
but there were protests almost everywhere, as I told you, in Kornitsa. Because immediately after 1964, the people who were most active were imprisoned.

437
1:19:11,000000 --> 1:19:11,990000
There was Ibrahim Bokmakov, who was imprisoned and deported.

438
1:19:16,000000 --> 1:19:16,990000
His son tells him that he was in Belene.

439
1:19:19,000000 --> 1:19:19,990000
I personally remember this man from 1973, I will tell you about him later. I have published in a magazine the memories of his son.

440
1:19:32,000000 --> 1:19:32,990000
He was a very close friend of my father and another man, a well-known person.

441
1:19:38,000000 --> 1:19:38,990000
I can say that from 1964 to 1969, around 1970, the people were working, getting married, having weddings, having fun, but gradually...

442
1:19:55,000000 --> 1:19:55,990000
But what did it mean to help yourself in Bulgaria between 1964 and the end of 1960. Yes, I heard this for the first time,

443
1:20:07,000000 --> 1:20:07,990000
I heard this in school,

444
1:20:11,000000 --> 1:20:11,990000
when they were making propaganda

445
1:20:14,000000 --> 1:20:14,990000
or when they said,

446
1:20:16,000000 --> 1:20:16,990000
you are Pumaci,

447
1:20:18,000000 --> 1:20:18,990000
and I had to ask my father,

448
1:20:20,000000 --> 1:20:20,990000
because in our folk songs,

449
1:20:23,000000 --> 1:20:23,990000
everywhere, and my grandmother never used the word

450
1:20:27,760000 --> 1:20:31
for Mace, she always said we are the Turks and they are the Bulgarians.

451
1:20:31,000000 --> 1:20:31,990000
Actually, the Turks and the Bulgarians, even Muslims were not used then.

452
1:20:35,400000 --> 1:20:49
And when I asked my father, my father was a very big opponent of communism, because he was a vulture. My grandmother is my grandmother's brother.

453
1:20:49,000000 --> 1:20:49,990000
He was sent to Belene, first to Bobovdol, and then to Belene, in connection with the Goryansk movement.

454
1:20:58,000000 --> 1:20:58,990000
He was there, so our whole family passed through there. My family was in the village, my father first in Bovodol, then in Belene, and after that he was released from Belene.

455
1:21:31,280000 --> 1:21:38
He did not tell, but my father told me a lot about these things, especially, for example, we had neighbors,

456
1:21:38,000000 --> 1:21:38,990000
I had a co-student, a Bulgarian, whose parents were mothers, and as a small child she was evicted,

457
1:21:45,000000 --> 1:21:45,990000
and her grandfather had fled to Greece and nothing was heard from him.

458
1:21:51,000000 --> 1:21:51,990000
So there were many families around us, evicted,

459
1:21:55,000000 --> 1:21:55,990000
both from our people, from the Mace, and from the Bulgarians.

460
1:21:58,000000 --> 1:21:58,990000
From the Bulgarians in 1949-1950, from Lizhnitsa, from Breznitsa, from everywhere.

461
1:22:03,000000 --> 1:22:03,990000
Some of them then went to Turkey, some for Breznica, and some for Turkey.

462
1:22:07,000000 --> 1:22:07,990000
So, the question is whether the border was illegally crossed?

463
1:22:11,000000 --> 1:22:11,990000
Did they cross the border illegally at the end of the 1950s?

464
1:22:15,000000 --> 1:22:15,990000
No, no, no. They were deported in the 1950s, in the year of 1949, 1948, 1949.

465
1:22:23,000000 --> 1:22:23,990000
The regular exchange, yes. There were settlements in northern Bulgaria, they settled in Plachkovci and in the villages around Plachkovci and then they moved to Turkey in 1951.

466
1:22:37,000000 --> 1:22:37,990000
So my grandmother's eldest sister then, for Turkey.

467
1:22:45,000000 --> 1:22:45,990000
During those years, when you were in that I would not believe in history.

468
1:23:08,000000 --> 1:23:08,990000
Besides, I did not believe in history, I was even more so that I had heard about what we have experienced.

469
1:23:15,000000 --> 1:23:15,990000
Because in history terrible things were said, we were the leaders, the Muslims and Turks. I do not think that people are still like that.

470
1:23:26,000000 --> 1:23:26,990000
Even more so, I know about the case

471
1:23:29,000000 --> 1:23:29,990000
when my great-grandfather was killed in 1914.

472
1:23:32,000000 --> 1:23:32,990000
Before that, his father was killed.

473
1:23:35,000000 --> 1:23:35,990000
I was already talking about Palatik.

474
1:23:38,000000 --> 1:23:38,990000
Then, he was in Belene.

475
1:23:41,000000 --> 1:23:41,990000
And these things that I personally saw in 1964

476
1:23:44,000000 --> 1:23:44,990000
made me not believe in history and some literary writings,

477
1:23:49,000000 --> 1:23:49,990000
so I studied only for grades, I argued with the teachers, of course, but in the early 70s, in the early 70s, for us the school was a terrible thing for us.

478
1:24:05,000000 --> 1:24:05,990000
An inquisition started.

479
1:24:07,000000 --> 1:24:07,990000
They just didn't tell us the subjects,

480
1:24:13,000000 --> 1:24:13,990000
they constantly told us propaganda texts,

481
1:24:17,000000 --> 1:24:17,990000
they read them, they let us on our radio stations,

482
1:24:20,000000 --> 1:24:20,990000
we ran through the corridors of various...

483
1:24:23,000000 --> 1:24:23,990000
Excuse me, Zeneb, something is wrong down there. We ran through the corridors, we started to go out, and then we ended up in the middle of the radio,

484
1:24:48,440000 --> 1:24:53,760000
we were all against the school, against the politics.

485
1:24:53,760000 --> 1:24:58,360000
The population in Kornitsa was already shocked,

486
1:24:58,360000 --> 1:25:08,060000
because they started changing the names of newborns. In general, the atmosphere in the village was such that

487
1:25:08,060000 --> 1:25:14,860000
you could not live in a calm environment,

488
1:25:14,860000 --> 1:25:18,400000
with every change of day,

489
1:25:18,400000 --> 1:25:20,700000
they were getting more and more,

490
1:25:20,700000 --> 1:25:28
and we could not practice our traditions,

491
1:25:28,000000 --> 1:25:28,990000
to have weddings.

492
1:25:32,000000 --> 1:25:32,990000
They stopped doing it.

493
1:25:34,000000 --> 1:25:34,990000
Do you remember when you first heard

494
1:25:36,000000 --> 1:25:36,990000
in the early 70s that the names were changed?

495
1:25:39,000000 --> 1:25:39,990000
That a new campaign was starting

496
1:25:41,000000 --> 1:25:41,990000
and this time it was obviously more decisive

497
1:25:44,000000 --> 1:25:44,990000
from the government.

498
1:25:45,000000 --> 1:25:45,990000
I heard from the very beginning, because my father constantly listened to the radio,

499
1:25:50,000000 --> 1:25:50,990000
he received newspapers and everything that happened in the beginning in the Smolensk region,

500
1:25:56,000000 --> 1:25:56,990000
of course they had a connection, he was learning and he was a man who shared absolutely everything with me, even though I was small.

501
1:26:08,000000 --> 1:26:08,990000
So I learned everything he actually learned from his neighbors or from other people.

502
1:26:15,000000 --> 1:26:15,990000
What kind of radio did you listen to?

503
1:26:19,000000 --> 1:26:19,990000
He listened to Western radio stations. There was a radio over the wall,

504
1:26:25,440000 --> 1:26:31,520000
put together, and the first thing to do was to turn on the radio.

505
1:26:31,520000 --> 1:26:36
Before the radio stopped, it actually worked and so it stopped.

506
1:26:36,000000 --> 1:26:36,990000
As I said, he received almost all newspapers and tried to read between the lines

507
1:26:42,400000 --> 1:26:45
to understand what was actually happening in Bulgaria.

508
1:26:46,000000 --> 1:26:46,990000
Yes, and what was the behavior of the Bulgarian authorities when the name was changed?

509
1:26:55,000000 --> 1:26:55,990000
What do you remember from the name change in 1972-1973?

510
1:27:02,000000 --> 1:27:02,990000
Unfortunately, I remember everything, because I was already in 1972-1974, and in 1973 I was 15 years old.

511
1:27:11,000000 --> 1:27:11,990000
And because, as I said, we were repressed the violence in Bulgaria, against the assimilation policy.

512
1:27:31,000000 --> 1:27:31,990000
So I knew all this and I constantly listened to it in school.

513
1:27:38,000000 --> 1:27:38,990000
I also tried to understand what happens and what they talk about in the school.

514
1:27:46,000000 --> 1:27:46,990000
Besides, it was not impossible for us children not to feel,

515
1:27:56,000000 --> 1:27:56,990000
because not only in the school, but we no with the elderly, we were waiting for the names to be changed in the village,

516
1:28:12,000000 --> 1:28:12,990000
because we heard outside in other villages what had happened.

517
1:28:17,000000 --> 1:28:17,990000
There were talks of victims, of murdered women and girls.

518
1:28:22,000000 --> 1:28:22,990000
Of course, after that I realized that some were faithful, some of them were not faithful, but all sorts of rumors came to our village, to the elderly and all this we, the children, know.

519
1:28:37,000000 --> 1:28:37,990000
When you say we didn't have holidays, we didn't have weddings, you have... weren't they imposed such things because of the anxiety? Yes, yes. They were already forbidden, it was not possible.

520
1:28:50,000000 --> 1:28:50,990000
People were also not in the mood to get married.

521
1:28:54,000000 --> 1:28:54,990000
People were already married secretly, they did not exclude civil marriages,

522
1:28:58,000000 --> 1:28:58,990000
because they had to get married.

523
1:29:00,000000 --> 1:29:00,990000
The names, the children did not register.

524
1:29:03,000000 --> 1:29:03,990000
The women were forced to be born at home,

525
1:29:06,000000 --> 1:29:06,990000
in very difficult conditions, only in the most critical situations,

526
1:29:10,000000 --> 1:29:10,990000
they were sent to Godse Delychev.

527
1:29:14,000000 --> 1:29:14,990000
And there they had to change the names of their children.

528
1:29:18,000000 --> 1:29:18,990000
The women, I remember, the mothers of the newborns,

529
1:29:23,000000 --> 1:29:23,990000
attacked the council to take out the registered Bulgarian names of the newborns.

530
1:29:34,000000 --> 1:29:34,990000
So the people who did not have children felt happy that they did not have children and that they would not with Bulgarian names. You were 15 years old during the conflict.

531
1:29:48,040000 --> 1:29:50,440000
Can you tell us about these events?

532
1:29:50,440000 --> 1:30:12
What actually happened in your native Kornitsa at that time? And the worst thing that happened was that a neighbor of ours, Ramazan, came to our village,

533
1:30:12,000000 --> 1:30:12,990000
it was 1972, he told about what they had done in a village in Kazanvyshko, in Dolno Izvorovo, how they had been opposed for several months

534
1:30:27,000000 --> 1:30:27,990000
and how in the end they managed to convince the police

535
1:30:31,000000 --> 1:30:31,990000
to refuse to change their names.

536
1:30:34,000000 --> 1:30:34,990000
And this was a piece of news that gave

537
1:30:38,000000 --> 1:30:38,990000
great hope to all people and they decided that

538
1:30:43,000000 --> 1:30:43,990000
if we do the same and oppose it,

539
1:30:47,240000 --> 1:30:51,240000
because they constantly claimed that all this is voluntary,

540
1:30:51,240000 --> 1:30:57,520000
no one will rape us, we ourselves have to decide,

541
1:30:57,520000 --> 1:31:02,320000
because it is necessary for the unification of the nation,

542
1:31:02,320000 --> 1:31:08
for Bulgaria to develop more and more successfully,

543
1:31:08,000000 --> 1:31:08,990000
and so on. You know the propaganda, the communist propaganda,

544
1:31:12,000000 --> 1:31:12,990000
people refused, of course.

545
1:31:15,000000 --> 1:31:15,990000
And after this connection of our village, or the more prominent people of our village,

546
1:31:22,000000 --> 1:31:22,990000
with the people from Lzhnitsa, Breznitsa and Kornitsa, who lived there, began to have a more organized opposition.

547
1:31:32,000000 --> 1:31:32,990000
Despite this, there was also an organized opposition before.

548
1:31:36,000000 --> 1:31:36,990000
The fathers of the children had been to Sofia, they had written protest letters that their children were being raped by Bulgarian men, that they would not accept this.

549
1:31:50,000000 --> 1:31:50,990000
These things were actually organized by the young people. and in fact gave a much bigger blow to all the villagers to join this opposition,

550
1:32:11,520000 --> 1:32:16,520000
so that they could manage to keep their names.

551
1:32:16,520000 --> 1:32:30
That was actually the mockery that was done with the people who were detained outside the village, with our workers outside the village,

552
1:32:30,000000 --> 1:32:30,990000
they were tortured, drunk and brought to the village and if we do not allow them to enter the village and take the elderly one by one and and to They were on state duty, they actually resigned from this job.

553
1:33:30,000000 --> 1:33:30,990000
For this reason, one of these brigadiers, who had also filed a resignation letter,

554
1:33:40,000000 --> 1:33:40,990000
was arrested by Godse Delchev in one of the cars and they wanted to take him from home and put him from Godse Delchev and wanted to take him from the house and drive him to Godse Delchev.

555
1:33:48,280000 --> 1:34:00,760000
Then the whole, first the women, then the men gathered and did not allow the next woman to be taken and driven to Godse Delchev and maltreated.

556
1:34:00,760000 --> 1:34:08
But after they did not allow, I was also there, of course, because I was everywhere, I was very active.

557
1:34:08,000000 --> 1:34:08,990000
After we were not allowed to go there, two or three hours passed, they came with border guards, border dogs,

558
1:34:17,000000 --> 1:34:17,990000
they were carrying horses and soldiers, until I realized that there was troops had arrived in the village,

559
1:34:29,000000 --> 1:34:29,990000
our people gathered again, lit the fire because it was very hot, and they started to wait.

560
1:34:40,000000 --> 1:34:40,990000
The soldiers passed by, but the people were frightened, they could not stay at home anymore.

561
1:34:47,000000 --> 1:34:47,990000
And so, on January 23, 1973, the process of organizing the people from the village of Kornitsa began,

562
1:34:56,000000 --> 1:34:56,990000
which lasted until March 29, when we were attacked by troops, volunteers, militia, military, armored transport,ewitnesses say, the whole highway was full of equipment,

563
1:35:32,000000 --> 1:35:32,990000
transport vehicles that entered Kornitsa and carried in the most brutal way. In fact, the Luzhnitsa also came,

564
1:35:46,000000 --> 1:35:46,990000
they made meetings several times in our village

565
1:35:49,000000 --> 1:35:49,990000
to convince us to agree.

566
1:35:52,000000 --> 1:35:52,990000
Everyone changed their names,

567
1:35:55,000000 --> 1:35:55,990000
why are we opposing?

568
1:35:58,000000 --> 1:35:58,990000
We were Bulgarians,

569
1:36:01,000000 --> 1:36:01,990000
will the Turks also change their names?

570
1:36:04,000000 --> 1:36:04,990000
And so on. I personally heard from Dilgerov who said

571
1:36:07,000000 --> 1:36:07,990000
that this is not being talked about much,

572
1:36:10,000000 --> 1:36:10,990000
do not be afraid, soon we will change the names of the Turks,

573
1:36:13,000000 --> 1:36:13,990000
but this was not something that could be done for us.

574
1:36:16,000000 --> 1:36:16,990000
You are talking about the first secretary of the district committee of the Party of Blagoevgrad.

575
1:36:20,000000 --> 1:36:20,990000
Yes, the first secretary of the district committee of the Communist Party Committee.

576
1:36:25,000000 --> 1:36:25,990000
He came several times.

577
1:36:27,000000 --> 1:36:27,990000
Many people came from Lzhnitsa and participated in these meetings.

578
1:36:32,000000 --> 1:36:32,990000
They listened. Of course, we ignored them.

579
1:36:35,000000 --> 1:36:35,990000
We didn't want to listen to them because they lied to us,

580
1:36:38,000000 --> 1:36:38,990000
looking us in the eyes, that they had nothing to do with anyone,

581
1:36:43,000000 --> 1:36:43,990000
they had nothing to do with anything bad, They did not behave badly, no one was beaten,

582
1:36:47,920000 --> 1:36:50,400000
all of this was voluntary.

583
1:36:50,400000 --> 1:36:53,840000
From Breznitsa, which is a little further away from us,

584
1:36:53,840000 --> 1:36:56,480000
a little less people participated, but they also came.

585
1:36:56,480000 --> 1:37:02,720000
But both villages had told us that they were happy with our protest,

586
1:37:02,720000 --> 1:37:08
that if something happens, they would come and support us.

587
1:37:08,000000 --> 1:37:08,990000
So they also supported us.

588
1:37:10,000000 --> 1:37:10,990000
And we knew about it, they had patrols every night.

589
1:37:15,000000 --> 1:37:15,990000
If something happened, we had to let go.

590
1:37:19,000000 --> 1:37:19,990000
The lamps of the mosque, which actually lit during the month of Ramadan in the morning when we had to start eating and in the evening when the fasts were actually completed.

591
1:37:34,000000 --> 1:37:34,990000
What do you remember from the square, there were the fireworks.

592
1:37:45,000000 --> 1:37:45,990000
Me and my first brother, Chetka, we were there until 1 o'clock, and the mother told us,

593
1:37:52,000000 --> 1:37:52,990000
go home already, you will be late. We of women, children, men, they called for help, they attacked us,

594
1:38:13,120000 --> 1:38:25
I quickly went out and saw that fire and the tanks were coming towards us.

595
1:38:25,000000 --> 1:38:25,990000
That was when they killed my father-in-law.

596
1:38:28,000000 --> 1:38:28,990000
I didn't know that he was the one who called out that Yusen Karahalilov was killed.

597
1:38:34,000000 --> 1:38:34,990000
I went to him, I was at the bakery, right before us.

598
1:38:39,000000 --> 1:38:39,990000
That man was lying on his face, I could only see his face.

599
1:38:47,000000 --> 1:38:47,990000
When I went to touch him, I thought he was wounded because blood was flowing from his head.

600
1:38:52,000000 --> 1:38:52,990000
They surrounded us, the soldiers, and everyone said,

601
1:38:57,000000 --> 1:38:57,990000
run, I saw the man, my sister-in-law, my brother,

602
1:39:03,000000 --> 1:39:03,990000
he said, Zenev, let's go on because they surround us,

603
1:39:07,340000 --> 1:39:12,400000
we broke through the blockade and I went to my grandmother on the river.

604
1:39:12,400000 --> 1:39:17,600000
Going to my grandmother, I stayed there because I could not go home,

605
1:39:17,600000 --> 1:39:22,240000
because it was full of police, horse army and so on,

606
1:39:22,240000 --> 1:39:27
and several men were And in the house several men had hidden,

607
1:39:27,000000 --> 1:39:27,990000
they came to the house, they discovered the men,

608
1:39:32,000000 --> 1:39:32,990000
the whole house was like that, because actually

609
1:39:36,000000 --> 1:39:36,990000
my aunt Lele was walking in the village,

610
1:39:40,000000 --> 1:39:40,990000
they entered his room, took all the Korans, all the books,

611
1:39:47,000000 --> 1:39:47,990000
and we were... a girl who had also hidden there, me,

612
1:39:52,000000 --> 1:39:52,990000
one of the monks, not Lelemi, I don't know where,

613
1:39:56,000000 --> 1:39:56,990000
their husband was exiled, and the soldiers said to a girl who was two years older than me, girl, come down to fix the room.

614
1:40:08,200000 --> 1:40:13,480000
Actually, I'm sure they would have raped her if she had left,

615
1:40:13,480000 --> 1:40:17,820000
but the woman of this, she said,

616
1:40:17,820000 --> 1:40:26
come on, if necessary, I will go down to fix the room.

617
1:40:26,000000 --> 1:40:26,990000
She doesn't know anything, she is not from this house.

618
1:40:29,000000 --> 1:40:29,990000
I actually caught my child's bed and that's how it ended.

619
1:40:35,000000 --> 1:40:35,990000
It was there that those who were on the street started to shout,

620
1:40:41,000000 --> 1:40:41,990000
these soldiers and civilians,

621
1:40:43,000000 --> 1:40:43,990000
the Luzhnitsa is coming to help, the Luzhnitsa is coming to help.

622
1:40:47,000000 --> 1:40:47,990000
And from this place where I am, I saw the hill of the Luzhnitsa, from where the people really went down.

623
1:40:55,000000 --> 1:40:55,990000
Zeynep, there is a problem with the camera, it disappeared.

624
1:41:00,000000 --> 1:41:00,990000
Yes.

625
1:41:02,000000 --> 1:41:02,990000
You closed the camera without asking. Yes, now it's good.

626
1:41:08,000000 --> 1:41:08,990000
Yes. In fact, I managed to see from there how they came out of the houses to drive them to the school and to lock them up one by one,

627
1:41:30,000000 --> 1:41:30,990000
actually they stopped dealing with us and started chasing the liars who had to help us. and suddenly they started to shout in the streets, because the house was on two houses from the main street of the village,

628
1:41:52,000000 --> 1:41:52,990000
to say that Breznitsa is coming, Breznitsa is coming, go on.

629
1:41:56,000000 --> 1:41:56,990000
And with horses they started to go to Breznitsa. Of course, it was't see from there. After that, I started to say that I had to go home.

630
1:42:09,000000 --> 1:42:09,990000
I don't know what happened to my mother, my father, what happened to them.

631
1:42:13,000000 --> 1:42:13,990000
I went down and asked, there were civilians,

632
1:42:18,000000 --> 1:42:18,990000
I asked, can I go home?

633
1:42:22,000000 --> 1:42:22,990000
They said, what are you doing here?

634
1:42:24,000000 --> 1:42:24,990000
I said, I barely live here, go quickly.

635
1:42:27,000000 --> 1:42:27,990000
And I went to my house, it was very close, I went to my house,

636
1:42:32,000000 --> 1:42:32,990000
our house is exactly to the square,

637
1:42:37,000000 --> 1:42:37,990000
just after a very short time my father was not at home,

638
1:42:42,000000 --> 1:42:42,990000
my uncle was not at home,

639
1:42:44,000000 --> 1:42:44,990000
the people who had hidden from the fight, from all this, were at home.

640
1:42:50,000000 --> 1:42:50,990000
My mother told me that they were taken and expelled outside the house.

641
1:42:54,000000 --> 1:42:54,990000
And we stayed at home, only my grandmother, my cousin's wife, who was beaten in the school,

642
1:43:02,000000 --> 1:43:02,990000
and the whole family was in the blue, my mother, who came out of me because she was sick,

643
1:43:07,000000 --> 1:43:07,990000
me, my brother and two children, actually four children,

644
1:43:13,000000 --> 1:43:13,990000
four children and two wives and my grandmother.

645
1:43:17,000000 --> 1:43:17,990000
And at one point civilians arrived again and said,

646
1:43:22,000000 --> 1:43:22,990000
take something from my pocket and come with us.

647
1:43:26,000000 --> 1:43:26,990000
Where are we going? Ask us a lot, take it.

648
1:43:32,000000 --> 1:43:32,990000
And we were wondering what to take, we started to take something,

649
1:43:37,000000 --> 1:43:37,990000
and one of them said, if there is something, a bean or something else, take a little bean and go." And my grandmother, she could not say anything else,

650
1:43:48,000000 --> 1:43:48,990000
she called all the ladies and gentlemen,

651
1:43:51,000000 --> 1:43:51,990000
and she said,

652
1:43:52,000000 --> 1:43:52,990000
but gentlemen, why are you doing this?

653
1:43:54,000000 --> 1:43:54,990000
I said, gentlemen, why are you doing this?

654
1:43:57,000000 --> 1:43:57,990000
What am I going to do?

655
1:43:58,000000 --> 1:43:58,990000
They just left her alone in the house.

656
1:44:01,000000 --> 1:44:01,990000
Here alone we have animals, everything, and then, because my mother is sick,

657
1:44:08,500000 --> 1:44:13
she is leaving, Chicho's wife told me,

658
1:44:13,000000 --> 1:44:13,990000
I will leave my daughter, can she stay here?

659
1:44:16,500000 --> 1:44:21
She left with the youngest daughter, two years older than me,

660
1:44:21,000000 --> 1:44:21,990000
me, my brother and my mother took us to the hospital, we saw trucks there,

661
1:44:28,000000 --> 1:44:28,990000
they drove us to the hospital, full of people, wounded, blood, they took us to the truck and we ran.

662
1:44:38,000000 --> 1:44:38,990000
The truck was parked, no one told us where, with soldiers with machine guns, at the end of the truck.

663
1:44:46,400000 --> 1:44:49,800000
In fact, there were very few men in the trucks.

664
1:44:49,800000 --> 1:44:52,300000
There were full of women and children.

665
1:44:52,300000 --> 1:44:58,800000
Most of them were drunk, blue, as I say, faces or crossed.

666
1:44:58,800000 --> 1:45:02,600000
And they drove us, I think, to Sinitli, the train station.

667
1:45:02,600000 --> 1:45:05,500000
There they took us to Vlak,

668
1:45:05,500000 --> 1:45:08
from Vlak we went to the lower part,

669
1:45:08,000000 --> 1:45:08,990000
Sofia they threw us there,

670
1:45:10,000000 --> 1:45:10,990000
they didn't let anyone approach us,

671
1:45:14,500000 --> 1:45:17,500000
from there they took us to another Vlak,

672
1:45:17,500000 --> 1:45:19,500000
from there to the lower Dabnik,

673
1:45:19,500000 --> 1:45:24,500000
and from the lower Dabnik they started to take us to trucks,

674
1:45:24,500000 --> 1:45:26,340000
discovered trucks in this village,

675
1:45:26,340000 --> 1:45:31,660000
there were also other trucks with which they drove us to Simitli.

676
1:45:31,660000 --> 1:45:37,500000
From there, two families took us.

677
1:45:37,500000 --> 1:45:43,020000
Our family and actually the son of my uncle, my grandmother's brother,

678
1:45:43,020000 --> 1:45:49,020000
who was in Belene, Husein Babechkin, but he did not have it,

679
1:45:49,020000 --> 1:45:51,020000
neither did my father, of course.

680
1:45:51,020000 --> 1:45:54,500000
His wife was, the eldest child was in the first grade,

681
1:45:54,500000 --> 1:45:57,740000
or was it the second grade?

682
1:45:57,740000 --> 1:46:03,120000
One was, yes, the first grade boy, the girl was five years old,

683
1:46:03,120000 --> 1:46:06
and the youngest boy, 3 years old.

684
1:46:06,000000 --> 1:46:06,990000
I was 15, my brother was 12, because he was born much later than me.

685
1:46:15,000000 --> 1:46:15,990000
And so they left us in a village, which we later called the village of Slavovitsa in Pleven, they did not want to stay village and we actually understood where the family is.

686
1:46:51,000000 --> 1:46:51,990000
Actually, I told my mother that I had seen a Voychum, because there was another person, who was also called Hussein Karahalil.

687
1:47:11,000000 --> 1:47:11,990000
I do not know who he was, whether it was Voychum or someone else. They are first brothers in the family.

688
1:47:16,000000 --> 1:47:16,990000
You do not know if Voychum is still alive or dead?

689
1:47:20,000000 --> 1:47:20,990000
I do not know anything. I think he was wounded. When I came back, I saw the blood there.

690
1:47:27,500000 --> 1:47:29,500000
Excuse me, Zene, the camera is not working again.

691
1:47:29,500000 --> 1:47:31,500000
There is a problem with the camera.

692
1:47:31,500000 --> 1:47:38,500000
I saw the blood of my husband, but no one knows about the relatives.

693
1:47:38,500000 --> 1:47:52
My father came to us, we received a telegram, after about 9 days, my father wrote that he would come to you tomorrow,

694
1:47:52,000000 --> 1:47:52,990000
after 10 days he came to us, after 2 days he was sent, and after that, of course, we understood that my that Voichvomi was killed.

695
1:48:08,000000 --> 1:48:08,990000
How long did you spend in Slavovica with the relatives?

696
1:48:13,000000 --> 1:48:13,990000
Actually, since March 28, but unfortunately, the order says March 28, and in the order on March of us on March 29th.

697
1:48:25,000000 --> 1:48:25,990000
It is written that we were sent in May,

698
1:48:29,000000 --> 1:48:29,990000
so this continues and no one wants to make this mistake,

699
1:48:34,000000 --> 1:48:34,990000
because they sent us without any order from the Ministry of Internal Affairs

700
1:48:39,000000 --> 1:48:39,990000
and then decided to issue an order to deport all these people with the next party from other families.

701
1:48:48,720000 --> 1:48:53,920000
And what is the basis of this decree? What is the basis for the expulsion?

702
1:49:18,000000 --> 1:49:18,990000
that the pro-Turkish nationalism and opposition to the assimilatory policy should be seen in the same light, because we have several documents, but my father is a pro-Turkish nationalist,

703
1:49:25,760000 --> 1:49:31,160000
and we were without a certain term,

704
1:49:31,160000 --> 1:49:34,760000
forever, for life maybe,

705
1:49:34,760000 --> 1:49:38,760000
but a decision came out for liberation.

706
1:49:38,760000 --> 1:49:42,760000
We were on September 23, 1977, we received,

707
1:49:42,760000 --> 1:49:47
in fact, they gave us an order to be released,

708
1:49:47,000000 --> 1:49:47,990000
but only a month later we received another order.

709
1:49:51,000000 --> 1:49:51,990000
In the file of our father there is this order in which it is said that we will be canceled the order for eviction has been rejected, but we have no right to return to our native village

710
1:50:09,000000 --> 1:50:09,990000
and we have to continue living in the village of Slavovice.

711
1:50:13,000000 --> 1:50:13,990000
So we were not free.

712
1:50:16,000000 --> 1:50:16,990000
By the way, this happens to many of our other relatives,

713
1:50:21,000000 --> 1:50:21,990000
even people from the prison who leave without a prison sentence are exiled.

714
1:50:26,000000 --> 1:50:26,990000
Then the intervention begins with the decision of the party members,

715
1:50:31,000000 --> 1:50:31,990000
friends and other members of the state security.

716
1:50:34,000000 --> 1:50:34,990000
And you are 77 years old, you are almost 20 years old, right?

717
1:50:38,000000 --> 1:50:38,990000
Yes, 77. By the way, until then they tried to make us change our names, and they took out our passports, they were in Pleven,

718
1:50:46,840000 --> 1:50:51,840000
they were filming by force, I found these photos in my file.

719
1:50:51,840000 --> 1:50:55,840000
Then I was a full-time soldier, my mother and my father,

720
1:50:55,840000 --> 1:50:58,840000
we did not accept these passports, of course, and they returned them.

721
1:50:58,840000 --> 1:51:05
My father wrote several letters, honest ones, to Blagoevgrad, to Gosidelchev,

722
1:51:05,000000 --> 1:51:05,990000
and then we left our fathers there.

723
1:51:10,000000 --> 1:51:10,990000
Together with the other family, because there was an order, we just ran away from there.

724
1:51:15,000000 --> 1:51:15,990000
In 1978 we went to live in a village, almost semi-illegal, in Tolbuchensko,

725
1:51:20,000000 --> 1:51:20,990000
in the village of Feltveko, in the village of Fjeldfej-Galdianko. We lived there until the next campaign for the change of names in 1984-1985.

726
1:51:33,000000 --> 1:51:33,990000
What do you remember from this campaign in 1984-1985?

727
1:51:38,000000 --> 1:51:38,990000
Can it be compared to what you saw in 1972-73?

728
1:51:47,000000 --> 1:51:47,990000
What I saw in 1972-73 were repetitions in Krdzhalinsko,

729
1:51:54,000000 --> 1:51:54,990000
but much more light and fast.

730
1:51:58,000000 --> 1:51:58,990000
We had experts, they had experience and knew that everything had to be done with many soldiers, many participants and very quickly.

731
1:52:12,000000 --> 1:52:12,990000
So, in fact, when everything was happening in Krizhali, people listened to Radio Free Europe, I heard a lot about it, and Deutsche Welle, and all Western radio stations,

732
1:52:25,500000 --> 1:52:29
but they didn't believe us because they were making propaganda,

733
1:52:29,000000 --> 1:52:29,990000
that as they were saying to us, they were making propaganda,

734
1:52:33,000000 --> 1:52:33,990000
you are pure Turks, these people in Kyrgyzstan are not pure,

735
1:52:38,000000 --> 1:52:38,990000
so we changed the names of the party members,

736
1:52:41,000000 --> 1:52:41,990000
there the leaders were having meetings with the party leaders, with the teachers,

737
1:52:46,000000 --> 1:52:46,990000
they were told that they should not be afraid, but then the free people took stock of it all at once,

738
1:52:54,000000 --> 1:52:54,990000
and then it was clear. Of course, we as people with experience,

739
1:53:00,000000 --> 1:53:00,990000
by the way, I forgot to mention that when my father was being investigated,

740
1:53:09,500000 --> 1:53:14,320000
they also did the same to him, a laborer, in 1982,

741
1:53:14,320000 --> 1:53:23,560000
I was dismissed on June 6th, 1982,

742
1:53:23,560000 --> 1:53:28
he died of labor in the age of the Zlopolka prison at the age of 48 on June 9.

743
1:53:28,000000 --> 1:53:28,990000
He was investigated. There is absolutely nothing in his file.

744
1:53:32,000000 --> 1:53:32,990000
There is no protocol for the robbery.

745
1:53:35,000000 --> 1:53:35,990000
He also wanted to change his name.

746
1:53:39,000000 --> 1:53:39,990000
But let's go back to the 84-85th war. The people I believed in said,

747
1:53:47,500000 --> 1:53:51
they will soon come here and they will change your names.

748
1:53:51,000000 --> 1:53:51,990000
We had shared with someone about what had happened in Rosasna, they knew,

749
1:53:56,000000 --> 1:53:56,990000
but they believed that Turkey would allow them to change our names.

750
1:54:03,500000 --> 1:54:07
We are Turks, this is impossible, they say it will not happen.

751
1:54:07,000000 --> 1:54:07,990000
I just have to tell you that, among other things, from Turkey, on Turkish radio and others, and through people who were guests then. I can tell you that in Yablo, for example, in January, there were guests and peasants when this happened.

752
1:54:32,120000 --> 1:54:37,960000
Exactly during these days, they from Turkey said,

753
1:54:37,960000 --> 1:54:53
in fact, the people who were then in power or the other hall was the Minister-President, look not to enter the prisons, not to be expelled, this cannot continue.

754
1:54:53,000000 --> 1:54:53,990000
You cannot do anything.

755
1:54:56,000000 --> 1:54:56,990000
After they decided to change your mind with weapons, you should not oppose.

756
1:55:02,000000 --> 1:55:02,990000
Such rumors really indeed such people.

757
1:55:05,740000 --> 1:55:14,700000
And that is why they changed their names very quickly in Northern Bulgaria.

758
1:55:14,700000 --> 1:55:17,700000
We did not change them again, as people with experience.

759
1:55:17,700000 --> 1:55:24
I was at a class yesterday in my student book,

760
1:55:24,000000 --> 1:55:24,990000
the last session was on January 30th.

761
1:55:28,000000 --> 1:55:28,990000
That is, when I changed my name, I was in the January session.

762
1:55:33,000000 --> 1:55:33,990000
January 30th, 1985.

763
1:55:35,000000 --> 1:55:35,990000
Yes, in 1985.

764
1:55:37,000000 --> 1:55:37,990000
I was a student there, because after I retired for a year, I worked in the village department,

765
1:55:45,000000 --> 1:55:45,990000
then my student rights were restored and I left for good, because this was my love.

766
1:55:50,000000 --> 1:55:50,990000
And so they told me at the university, maybe this is better for you, and I left for good.

767
1:55:59,000000 --> 1:55:59,990000
However it went, in Shumen everything was visible, there were tanks on the streets.

768
1:56:08,000000 --> 1:56:08,990000
Colleagues who were regular and who were conducting tests at that time,

769
1:56:13,000000 --> 1:56:13,990000
you know that the January session was being conducted,

770
1:56:16,000000 --> 1:56:16,990000
they were called, the decanates were being threatened, they were being forced to change their names.

771
1:56:20,000000 --> 1:56:20,990000
I spoke to all the Turks because I knew them very well, we were together before,

772
1:56:25,000000 --> 1:56:25,990000
we had meetings, we all knew each other very well.

773
1:56:29,000000 --> 1:56:29,990000
And imagine, they had to show up on the test and they changed their names.

774
1:56:36,000000 --> 1:56:36,990000
They were just in a practice in a school, a gymnasium, Nikola Yonkov in Starov, in Shumen.

775
1:56:56,000000 --> 1:56:56,990000
I decided to see what was happening in the school, what the teachers were constantly moving around the streets,

776
1:57:05,000000 --> 1:57:05,990000
I was in an apartment with Turks who told me how the names of the students in the former VPA were changed.

777
1:57:14,000000 --> 1:57:14,990000
And the police with people, the soldiers, some of them were in military uniforms, and I asked them what they were doing.

778
1:57:21,000000 --> 1:57:21,990000
The Turks told me, they sent us because they were sending us because they were changing our names.

779
1:57:25,000000 --> 1:57:25,990000
They gave us a leave, those who changed their names gave us a leave, that's what they did with the boys before.

780
1:57:31,000000 --> 1:57:31,990000
And I decided to go in with them, when I already knew that they were going to Shumen that day.

781
1:57:38,000000 --> 1:57:38,990000
I went to the gymnasium and a boy was running out of the door, I was outside and I asked him,

782
1:57:45,360000 --> 1:57:46,560000
where are you going, what is happening?

783
1:57:46,560000 --> 1:57:48
He said, move away.

784
1:57:48,000000 --> 1:57:48,990000
And I went in, I went into the teacher's room,

785
1:57:52,000000 --> 1:57:52,990000
there was such a conversation.

786
1:57:54,560000 --> 1:57:58,640000
They had left the class,

787
1:57:58,640000 --> 1:58:02
at that time they had informed the little students

788
1:58:02,000000 --> 1:58:02,990000
that they had to change their names.

789
1:58:04,000000 --> 1:58:04,990000
And they had such a conversation, because my teacher, with whom I actually did an internship,

790
1:58:11,000000 --> 1:58:11,990000
was not there, no one knew me, they didn't know that I was married.

791
1:58:14,000000 --> 1:58:14,990000
And they said, this Zagolekar's son most demonstratively let go his voice.

792
1:58:23,000000 --> 1:58:23,990000
Then I realized that this boy was the son of Zagorekar Ochumen.

793
1:58:28,920000 --> 1:58:31,640000
Everyone spoke like that.

794
1:58:31,640000 --> 1:58:36,260000
They were Bulgarians and they were from the Hametans,

795
1:58:36,260000 --> 1:58:40,800000
actually from the Turks,

796
1:58:40,800000 --> 1:58:42,500000
and they were made by the Turks,

797
1:58:42,500000 --> 1:58:44,260000
although they spoke Turkish,

798
1:58:44,260000 --> 1:58:46
that's why their family names were changed. They are Turkish and they are doing something that they speak Turkish, so they change their names.

799
1:58:46,000000 --> 1:58:46,990000
I did not hear anyone say that this is not right in the teacher's room.

800
1:58:52,000000 --> 1:58:52,990000
Then I went out in the afternoon and waited for the next hour.

801
1:58:59,000000 --> 1:58:59,990000
I went out again and the girls were crying in the corridor. Zeynep, how do you explain that the Bulgarians have become victims of this official indoctrination?

802
1:59:12,000000 --> 1:59:12,990000
I explain it with the lies that have been constantly written in history and literature, with the propaganda that was being done against the population,

803
1:59:28,000000 --> 1:59:28,990000
so that there would be hatred against the Turks, against the Muslims, against the Fomans.

804
1:59:34,000000 --> 1:59:34,990000
This is the propaganda that...

805
1:59:36,000000 --> 1:59:36,990000
But the professors and academics are making up fat books with all their authority, right?

806
1:59:42,000000 --> 1:59:42,990000
Yes, yes, of course. Everyone was interested in it, even some people, even if they didn't believe, they knew that it was more convenient to keep silent and do what they were told.

807
1:59:54,000000 --> 1:59:54,990000
They couldn't say it out loud, but I will tell you about one of my colleagues, a colleague of mine, Svetlana Chervenbryag, who told merag Svetlana, who, what did they tell me when they changed their names,

808
2:00:07,000000 --> 2:00:07,990000
she was also a kindergarten student, but she wanted to finish this gymnasium in Shumen.

809
2:00:15,000000 --> 2:00:15,990000
The girls were crying and saying, but they want to change their names.

810
2:00:21,000000 --> 2:00:21,990000
They told us that they had to. I told them, why do you have to change their names,

811
2:00:25,000000 --> 2:00:25,990000
to talk to their parents,

812
2:00:29,000000 --> 2:00:29,990000
which meant that there were no phones at that time.

813
2:00:32,000000 --> 2:00:32,990000
And they said that they had not met at all,

814
2:00:35,000000 --> 2:00:35,990000
they spoke Turkish, of course,

815
2:00:37,000000 --> 2:00:37,990000
and that's why they believed me,

816
2:00:39,000000 --> 2:00:39,990000
otherwise they couldn't believe someone

817
2:00:42,000000 --> 2:00:42,990000
if he spoke Bulgarian to them.

818
2:00:44,000000 --> 2:00:44,990000
Okay, then we should take our bags and leave.

819
2:00:47,000000 --> 2:00:47,990000
So, I managed to tell this to some girls.

820
2:00:51,000000 --> 2:00:51,990000
This was in Schumen.

821
2:00:53,000000 --> 2:00:53,990000
We actually had an absolvent session,

822
2:00:55,000000 --> 2:00:55,990000
which I did not participate in,

823
2:00:57,000000 --> 2:00:57,990000
because we were actually in the last session.

824
2:01:00,000000 --> 2:01:00,990000
My colleague from Red Beach, Svetlana, told me,

825
2:01:07,000000 --> 2:01:07,990000
if you want to go to Red River, I will hide you and I will not hide you.

826
2:01:12,000000 --> 2:01:12,990000
I am against that.

827
2:01:14,000000 --> 2:01:14,990000
I said to myself that I cannot hide from that,

828
2:01:19,000000 --> 2:01:19,990000
but I thank her sincerely for the fact that a Bulgarian

829
2:01:23,000000 --> 2:01:23,990000
took this risk and said,

830
2:01:25,000000 --> 2:01:25,990000
I will hide you, don't change your name, and so on.

831
2:01:29,000000 --> 2:01:29,990000
Actually, I left at 30, I returned to the village, I had already requested, of course,

832
2:01:36,000000 --> 2:01:36,990000
a permit, given that I had night classes, I was there with my family,

833
2:01:41,000000 --> 2:01:41,990000
they did not deal with the widows, with my family, I returned to and saw that the house was only the mother and the little ones,

834
2:01:56,500000 --> 2:02:08,760000
my mother, my cousins' mother, and my brother, my cousin, had hidden and they were gone.

835
2:02:08,760000 --> 2:02:14,440000
The whole village was already with changed names, they were hiding somewhere,

836
2:02:14,440000 --> 2:02:18,360000
and we waited for what could happen, for them to come and take us,

837
2:02:18,360000 --> 2:02:21,200000
and so we changed our names. Of course, we received prizes,

838
2:02:21,200000 --> 2:02:26,500000
about one month after the Toglokhina Mevere, to appear in Mevere.

839
2:02:26,500000 --> 2:02:34
I have this prize in my folder.

840
2:02:34,000000 --> 2:02:34,990000
This was in February 1985, right?

841
2:02:37,500000 --> 2:02:45,620000
Yes, yes, yes, this was already in February, I think it was February, and they stopped us there, they tried to blame us,

842
2:02:45,620000 --> 2:02:52
because I told my father, among other things, to my great-grandfather,

843
2:02:52,000000 --> 2:02:52,990000
I said, there is no point in you standing and hiding,

844
2:02:56,220000 --> 2:03:00,240000
go outside, everyone has already changed their names,

845
2:03:00,240000 --> 2:03:02,240000
let's see what will happen.

846
2:03:02,240000 --> 2:03:07
And when they called us, they didn't hold him, they let us go.

847
2:03:07,000000 --> 2:03:07,990000
He was a suspect, when he was accused of not giving us these advice,

848
2:03:14,000000 --> 2:03:14,990000
not to change his name, they sent him to the police department.

849
2:03:17,000000 --> 2:03:17,990000
We didn't change our names, but they told us that there was nothing we could do,

850
2:03:23,000000 --> 2:03:23,990000
we couldn't hold money from the customs customs, we could not move anywhere, we were standing.

851
2:03:28,760000 --> 2:03:34,240000
And again they changed their names, but then they said that if you do not change your name,

852
2:03:34,240000 --> 2:03:49,200000
and here you are a bad example for the people, we will expel you either from here or we will take you back. Because we thought we were doing something, some kind of protest,

853
2:03:49,200000 --> 2:03:57,120000
we decided to leave the mothers alone, to leave them somewhere in a safer place

854
2:03:57,120000 --> 2:04:10
and then decide what to do. We were already four. There were four of us. The two boys from the two families left for Pleven, we were still residents of Pleven.

855
2:04:10,000000 --> 2:04:10,990000
The names of all of us were changed there, we thought that it was already April.

856
2:04:14,000000 --> 2:04:14,990000
They returned, gave us signs that we could move to Plesk, otherwise no one could move.

857
2:04:26,000000 --> 2:04:26,990000
From there we sold some things, we had animals, we loaded the luggage and left for the village of Chumenko,

858
2:04:36,000000 --> 2:04:36,990000
where we had some acquaintances and relatives who lived in this village for a very long time, for many years.

859
2:04:47,000000 --> 2:04:47,990000
We bought a house, we became married mothers and we decided to do something to was telling the truth about what was happening.

860
2:05:08,000000 --> 2:05:08,990000
We had already heard a lot about the of course, on the Free Europe, on BBC and other radio stations, we knew everything from there.

861
2:05:27,000000 --> 2:05:27,990000
We decided to have two of our colleagues from Tobokhin,

862
2:05:34,000000 --> 2:05:34,990000
the sixth, to try to enter some kind of Western embassy, to call journalists and tell what happened and what we have been through for so many years,

863
2:05:50,000000 --> 2:05:50,990000
for the repressions and for the violent assassination, the violent repression from the 70s or 60s to the 80s.

864
2:05:57,000000 --> 2:05:57,990000
He was a college student in Sofia, he had the Bulgarian embassy and had learned how to enter.

865
2:06:06,000000 --> 2:06:06,990000
We were six and we just didn't make it.

866
2:06:09,000000 --> 2:06:09,990000
The second plan was to escape through the Bulgarian-Roman border,

867
2:06:17,000000 --> 2:06:17,990000
to enter the Turkish embassy and to ask for journalists to tell us what was happening in Bulgaria.

868
2:06:26,600000 --> 2:06:33,300000
It was exactly then that the date was announced that Kenan Nevren will visit Romania.

869
2:06:33,300000 --> 2:06:41,200000
We had made it so that when we managed to get to Bucharest in the Anglican Embassy,

870
2:06:41,200000 --> 2:06:45
we would be able to go to Bucharest and so on.

871
2:06:45,000000 --> 2:06:45,990000
And we really did not manage to get there, we went back to Dobrich,

872
2:06:52,000000 --> 2:06:52,990000
but our brother, who was with a beard, was not allowed to take a ticket by plane.

873
2:07:00,000000 --> 2:07:00,990000
We arrived in Varna, we waited for him, he arrived with a train, and so we went to Silistra, we crossed the border, we slept in a family in a town there, we managed to get to Bukhores very early with a taxi, and waited for about 10 hours to be able to enter.

874
2:07:29,000000 --> 2:07:29,990000
However, when we approached, the Romanian police surrounded us, or security police, as they called these forces then, and they detained us and drove us to Bucharest.

875
2:07:48,000000 --> 2:07:48,990000
There they investigated us for two days and nights, after which they handed us over through Gurgiev questions to the Bulgarian authorities.

876
2:07:59,000000 --> 2:07:59,990000
Just to tell you that this night the Bulgarian authorities had given 9 fugitives.

877
2:08:05,000000 --> 2:08:05,990000
The first were from Krdzhali, they had tried to swim to the Danube,

878
2:08:10,000000 --> 2:08:10,990000
one of the girls had arrived, the other one did not know what the situation was,

879
2:08:16,000000 --> 2:08:16,990000
the other one had returned, but we did not meet them until we waited for the cars to come from the district authorities, where we are residents, to take us and drive us to the respective villages.

880
2:08:32,000000 --> 2:08:32,990000
The two groups have nothing in common. It's just that they are victims of political assimilation.

881
2:08:38,000000 --> 2:08:38,990000
No, no, no. While they were driving us with the catapult, a boy with a transistor and a rubber band in his arm was also put into the boat.

882
2:08:46,000000 --> 2:08:46,990000
The Romanian policeman pressed the button of the transistor and started singing Turkish songs.

883
2:08:56,000000 --> 2:08:56,990000
After we started talking to the boy in Turkish, he told us about the three of them,

884
2:09:02,000000 --> 2:09:02,990000
how they went through the night to cross the tunnel.

885
2:09:05,000000 --> 2:09:05,990000
And then we met them together in the stage in Rus.

886
2:09:11,000000 --> 2:09:11,990000
And we saw the other two with whom it happened.

887
2:09:15,000000 --> 2:09:15,990000
It was something terrible.

888
2:09:17,000000 --> 2:09:17,990000
People really did not go, as in the Kyrgyz, they did not have the opportunity to protest,

889
2:09:23,000000 --> 2:09:23,990000
because they were surrounded by stumps and so on.

890
2:09:26,000000 --> 2:09:26,990000
But they ran away. There are many suicides.

891
2:09:30,000000 --> 2:09:30,990000
In this village, where we were, in Afyavve Beldyankovo, after a few days, a man was killed.

892
2:09:37,000000 --> 2:09:37,990000
I know of many suicides in Eastern Bulgaria. This question is not at all...

893
2:09:41,000000 --> 2:09:41,990000
Suicide as a protest against the change of name. They can't accept it.

894
2:09:48,600000 --> 2:09:58,400000
Or some after the cruel in the militia, after the cruel there,

895
2:09:58,400000 --> 2:10:05
they go back to their homes, they and cannot stay,

896
2:10:05,000000 --> 2:10:05,990000
because they are doing things to themselves.

897
2:10:09,000000 --> 2:10:09,990000
There was a case of my colleague Chumek,

898
2:10:13,000000 --> 2:10:13,990000
who was killed by a man with a gun.

899
2:10:17,000000 --> 2:10:17,990000
There are many such cases,

900
2:10:19,000000 --> 2:10:19,990000
no one thinks about how much the victims

901
2:10:22,000000 --> 2:10:22,990000
of this inhuman, violent, bulgarization of Muslims, Roma, Muslims, Turks?

902
2:10:32,620000 --> 2:10:39,820000
The number of victims, as you know better than me, is probably over a million and a half.

903
2:10:39,820000 --> 2:10:47
What happened afterwards that? After that we were investigated.

904
2:10:47,000000 --> 2:10:47,990000
When we were arrested in Romania, we gave all sorts of addresses to the people we stayed with.

905
2:10:56,000000 --> 2:10:56,990000
On the way to Turkey we understood what we were going to talk about. We actually told the Romanian authorities everything. They brought us maps, told us and they told us,

906
2:11:09,000000 --> 2:11:09,990000
I emphasize, the security of Ceaușescu told us this.

907
2:11:15,000000 --> 2:11:15,990000
What you told us here, will remain here.

908
2:11:18,000000 --> 2:11:18,990000
Everything else you want to say, you will say it in Bulgaria,

909
2:11:23,000000 --> 2:11:23,990000
we will not give any evidence.

910
2:11:25,000000 --> 2:11:25,990000
And they really said what they wanted to say, because we wanted to get a very big decision,

911
2:11:31,000000 --> 2:11:31,990000
because we told what we could not tell the journalists from Romania.

912
2:11:36,000000 --> 2:11:36,990000
And then we talked about it. So you mean that the Romanian police have felt you, but have fulfilled the agreement with Bulgaria?

913
2:11:50,000000 --> 2:11:50,990000
Yes, they said that we have an agreement with them, so we are obliged to return you.

914
2:11:56,000000 --> 2:11:56,990000
There were two Bulgarian and Turkish translators, we worked with them,

915
2:12:05,240000 --> 2:12:11,040000
but anyway, we had enough time to understand the following.

916
2:12:11,040000 --> 2:12:15,440000
No one will know that we made an attempt to enter the English state.

917
2:12:15,440000 --> 2:12:21,440000
We will say that we went to Sofia to take our sister's brother in law, Yusuf Babichki,

918
2:12:21,440000 --> 2:12:29
from there we left, from there we left, he was not taken by plane, we left, we went to Romania and so on.

919
2:12:29,000000 --> 2:12:29,990000
And our results were so similar that they did not judge us for creating an organization.

920
2:12:40,000000 --> 2:12:40,990000
Why did you leave? Because did you not mention your names? But our two friends, a girl and a boy from Dobrich, gave a smaller sentence, only a year and a half of exilment.

921
2:12:52,000000 --> 2:12:52,990000
And we, as recidivists, who were written that we are still long years, we are heirs...

922
2:13:01,000000 --> 2:13:01,990000
And you are still from from the 72nd to the 3rd.

923
2:13:05,000000 --> 2:13:05,990000
Yes, we are a family of anti-communists and Turkish nationalists.

924
2:13:10,000000 --> 2:13:10,990000
That is why we accept the right path of the Bulgarian Communist Party

925
2:13:15,000000 --> 2:13:15,990000
to unite this population into the United Bulgarian Nation.

926
2:13:21,000000 --> 2:13:21,990000
You know this terminology.

927
2:13:23,000000 --> 2:13:23,990000
Yes, the one socialist nation.

928
2:13:25,800000 --> 2:13:29,400000
The socialist nation, I can say that.

929
2:13:29,400000 --> 2:13:40,200000
That's why we were given two years of confinement and two years of eviction,

930
2:13:40,200000 --> 2:13:49
and the girls were given two years and four and four months and two years in prison.

931
2:13:49,000000 --> 2:13:49,990000
The brother and sister stayed together in the same village.

932
2:13:55,000000 --> 2:13:55,990000
We moved with my cousin to her former prison. I want to tell you about the women who were in prison, who were put through one oritations to invite people to protest in Kyrgyzstan against the assimilation. There was a girl who was one of the participants and a member of the organization in the protests in Mumchil Grad.

933
2:14:52,000000 --> 2:14:52,990000
There was a woman from Yablonova who had written a letter to the trade hall and told about the bloody destruction of the peaceful protest of the population of Yablo in New January against the violent bulgarization.

934
2:15:08,500000 --> 2:15:16,500000
Therefore, she was sentenced to 5 years, and because she did not know that she was pregnant, she gave birth to the child in prison.

935
2:15:16,500000 --> 2:15:19,500000
She was over 45 years old.

936
2:15:19,500000 --> 2:15:26,480000
There was a woman from Shumen, Akosherka, who was also there and was sentenced to two years,

937
2:15:26,480000 --> 2:15:38,880000
for writing a letter to Dr. Zhitkov, in which she said that in fact the name of Sveta was not voluntarily approved by the authorities.

938
2:15:38,880000 --> 2:15:45
This was from the idea of a good two, or just wanted to protest?

939
2:15:45,000000 --> 2:15:45,990000
Exactly. But they found out that she was a woman and she was in prison. There were two girls married.

940
2:15:51,000000 --> 2:15:51,990000
There was also other experience of marriage, and no, as they say, three in the front, and then the other non-combatant was released and moved to a secluded place. Arista, of course, then we already got to know other old She was very brave for the gold trade, Magda Vaitova. She told us about all those who passed through there,

941
2:16:49,000000 --> 2:16:49,990000
specifically about the protest against the assimilation,

942
2:16:53,500000 --> 2:16:55,500000
she gave us data.

943
2:16:55,500000 --> 2:17:00
And even food was taken away from me, because I was very hungry,

944
2:17:00,000000 --> 2:17:00,990000
to have strength.

945
2:17:03,000000 --> 2:17:03,990000
But after I got out of prison, I had to move to the settlement.

946
2:17:09,000000 --> 2:17:09,990000
By the way, our two brothers were also in Belina, but in the first district.

947
2:17:15,000000 --> 2:17:15,990000
And in the first district there were many, now it is clear that people who were in the second district in Belene, but there were also over 20 people, maybe 30, who were in Belene prison under arrest.

948
2:17:34,000000 --> 2:17:34,990000
This is precisely why the assimilator policy was opposed not only in Stara Zagora and Pazarchik, but also in the first part of the Belene prison.

949
2:17:49,000000 --> 2:17:49,990000
How many years did you spend in the Slivenski prison? I was transferred to Russia and detained on July 11, 1985.

950
2:18:08,000000 --> 2:18:08,990000
On November 27, 1986, I left.

951
2:18:12,000000 --> 2:18:12,990000
The difference was only a couple of days, because my brother-in-law left after me,

952
2:18:15,000000 --> 2:18:15,990000
because they were calculating the working days there and some exchange was obtained.

953
2:18:21,000000 --> 2:18:21,990000
So I left two days before her, 17 months, because we worked instead of two years, 24 months I stayed.

954
2:18:32,000000 --> 2:18:32,990000
How far did you manage to get with your higher education? I told you about the eye exercises and the last session I had a test and I had stayed.

955
2:18:50,000000 --> 2:18:50,990000
Until then I had another test.

956
2:18:55,000000 --> 2:18:55,990000
I want to say which courses?

957
2:18:58,000000 --> 2:18:58,990000
Yes, with the changes of names.

958
2:19:00,000000 --> 2:19:00,990000
Until June, this remained my last course.

959
2:19:03,000000 --> 2:19:03,990000
In the 80s I entered, then left with the state exams.

960
2:19:07,000000 --> 2:19:07,990000
And when I was already evicted, I had to work again and I was given the right to study.

961
2:19:16,000000 --> 2:19:16,990000
After the Slivenski prison, where did you live?

962
2:19:19,000000 --> 2:19:19,990000
I had to go to the village of Botjevo, where we had two years of eviction. I had to take my mother.

963
2:19:26,500000 --> 2:19:32
I asked the prosecutor for a suspension because I had 10 days to stay.

964
2:19:32,000000 --> 2:19:32,990000
It was winter.

965
2:19:34,000000 --> 2:19:34,990000
After a month with my mother, my brother-in-law drove us with the car to Botchevo Mihaylovdravsko.

966
2:19:41,000000 --> 2:19:41,990000
My brother-in-law away before me. Her father was already exiled from Belene, exiled from the second district.

967
2:19:52,000000 --> 2:19:52,990000
Her mother had gone to her father, and she had gone alone to the village of Cherni Vrh, Mikhailo Gradsko, close to Gotyevo.

968
2:20:09,000000 --> 2:20:09,990000
I must emphasize that in all these villages there were at least two families of displaced people.

969
2:20:17,000000 --> 2:20:17,990000
We were three in our village, or two, but two people, because these white people and others who only have a settlement were settled in the north-west of Bulgaria.

970
2:20:29,000000 --> 2:20:29,990000
Of course, there were very afraid of us,

971
2:20:46,240000 --> 2:20:50
treated us very badly, but soon they understood what we were representing.

972
2:20:50,000000 --> 2:20:50,990000
They became our defenders, they were our thinkers.

973
2:20:53,500000 --> 2:20:58
We had very good relations with them, they didn't lie to us much.

974
2:20:58,000000 --> 2:20:58,990000
So they told us and we left.

975
2:21:02,000000 --> 2:21:02,990000
We made a connection with them. We were constantly in touch, we supported each other materially and morally.

976
2:21:10,000000 --> 2:21:10,990000
And that's how we lived in the country.

977
2:21:13,000000 --> 2:21:13,990000
How did your activity within the independent society for human rights come about?

978
2:21:19,000000 --> 2:21:19,990000
Well, over time, of course, we, because we constantly went with a transistor everywhere, according to my father's traditions,

979
2:21:28,440000 --> 2:21:34,240000
we listened and learned about the creation of an independent society that protects the rights of the person.

980
2:21:34,240000 --> 2:21:45
We just watched with great joy how the members of the Society, without being afraid,

981
2:21:45,000000 --> 2:21:45,990000
tried to create an organization.

982
2:21:48,000000 --> 2:21:48,990000
Then we heard the statement of Giusun Otvarna,

983
2:21:54,000000 --> 2:21:54,990000
who talked about the main point of his husband.

984
2:21:58,000000 --> 2:21:58,990000
That's why we decided to contact this organization,

985
2:22:06,500000 --> 2:22:12
because the secretary and the speaker of the association were in Mikhailo Grad.

986
2:22:12,000000 --> 2:22:12,990000
That is why we sent the youngest brother, the boy, who was 3 years old when we moved to Glevensk,

987
2:22:21,000000 --> 2:22:21,990000
he was over 18 years old, and we could not go to Mikhailo Grad, we were settled,

988
2:22:28,000000 --> 2:22:28,990000
the teachers were connected with each of them, and the secretary was Dimitar Tomov.

989
2:22:39,000000 --> 2:22:39,990000
And in this way we became, in fact, we first wanted to protect our rights,

990
2:22:49,000000 --> 2:22:49,990000
because they claimed that they were protecting the rights of all citizens in Bulgaria.

991
2:22:54,000000 --> 2:22:54,990000
We were one of the people who were constantly repressed for decades,

992
2:23:00,000000 --> 2:23:00,990000
close to 60 years, if we make a estimate, 20 years, over 20 years.

993
2:23:05,000000 --> 2:23:05,990000
And they said, yes, of course, but we want to connect with the Turks,

994
2:23:12,000000 --> 2:23:12,990000
at the moment they are the most vulnerable, they need help,

995
2:23:17,000000 --> 2:23:17,990000
I also think that they will also join, you can make contact with them.

996
2:23:22,000000 --> 2:23:22,990000
We said yes, we are not afraid, we have nothing against it.

997
2:23:29,000000 --> 2:23:29,990000
And we joined the four of us,

998
2:23:32,000000 --> 2:23:32,990000
while we left in the shadow Kemal, the little one,

999
2:23:35,000000 --> 2:23:35,990000
who connected us so that he could always be the reserve.

1000
2:23:41,000000 --> 2:23:41,990000
But he was, of course, he knew everything and was constantly with us and was an active participant in all our activities.

1001
2:23:51,000000 --> 2:23:51,990000
What do you remember about the main fight of Peter Manolov and the Mayas?

1002
2:23:59,000000 --> 2:23:59,990000
Yes, we were connected, they began to contact us with Western journalists, they failed.

1003
2:24:06,000000 --> 2:24:06,990000
Because of this, the police, from Mihailo Gratni or LOM, LOM from the police forced us to return to Shumen,

1004
2:24:15,000000 --> 2:24:15,990000
although we had not yet completed the exhumation.

1005
2:24:20,000000 --> 2:24:20,990000
In December, the king of December had to hear mine. In October they made us return to Shumen,

1006
2:24:29,000000 --> 2:24:29,990000
when they said that in Shumen we had a part in the militia,

1007
2:24:33,000000 --> 2:24:33,990000
and that in the evening of 19.40 was a certain hour of the morning.

1008
2:24:39,000000 --> 2:24:39,990000
We passed by and they told us to return to the village and wait for us to come back.

1009
2:24:48,500000 --> 2:24:52,420000
We protested, we were exiled. Why are you returning here?

1010
2:24:52,420000 --> 2:24:58,420000
Because they were actually distance from Mikhailgrad, but after we understood that they would leave us,

1011
2:24:58,420000 --> 2:25:17
we decided to build a structure there among the people of this area, who already knew about our history, that we were in the background of our exiled, for some of them we were already, for example, for the continuation.

1012
2:25:18,000000 --> 2:25:18,990000
What do you remember from the May events of 1989?

1013
2:25:24,000000 --> 2:25:24,990000
The Mayan events of 1989. Before they kicked us out of there, we of course left.

1014
2:25:29,000000 --> 2:25:29,990000
People who were to replace us, a very good organization was already created.

1015
2:25:35,000000 --> 2:25:35,990000
And what do I remember?

1016
2:25:38,000000 --> 2:25:38,990000
We again watched all the radio stations, the Turkish radio and television. So when we heard about the bloodshed of the peaceful protests,

1017
2:25:48,320000 --> 2:25:59,080000
we in the Bursa, some dissidents who are fighting against the violence assimilation in Bursa,

1018
2:25:59,080000 --> 2:26:10
we made a protest of the main point in support of the protest of the main old woman in support of the people's desire to return their names,

1019
2:26:10,000000 --> 2:26:10,990000
to allow them to exercise their religious and national holidays freely. But in May I was invited by several people to participate in the Paris conference.

1020
2:26:31,000000 --> 2:26:31,990000
There I had the opportunity to meet with Peter Boidzheev, Peter Manolov, Fuscolo was there. We tried to give the interview and tell the Western journalists, the Western society,

1021
2:26:51,560000 --> 2:26:57,560000
about what it was like to fight for the people, for the victims,

1022
2:26:57,560000 --> 2:27:10
and the truth about the Mayan events and the bloodshed of the peaceful protests of the people of Southeast Bulgaria and then, of course, of Southeast.

1023
2:27:14,000000 --> 2:27:14,990000
Professor Zafer, can you tell us what is the best thing that happened between 1989 and 2024.

1024
2:27:27,000000 --> 2:27:27,990000
I want to ask, what has changed?

1025
2:27:31,000000 --> 2:27:31,990000
What is the difference now, 35-40 years after these events,

1026
2:27:39,000000 --> 2:27:39,990000
in the relationship between Bulgaria and Turkey, between Bulgarians and Turks,

1027
2:27:43,000000 --> 2:27:43,990000
between Christians and Turkey, between Bulgarians and Turks, between Christians and Muslims?

1028
2:27:46,000000 --> 2:27:46,990000
Many things have changed, I can say that. First, people can freely to Bulgaria, Bulgaria, Bulgaria, they can come to the city,

1029
2:28:11,500000 --> 2:28:30
to see the country they write about, they wrote and still write, unfortunately rest in the coasts that there are in the oceans,

1030
2:28:30,000000 --> 2:28:30,990000
to see the attitude of the people.

1031
2:28:34,000000 --> 2:28:34,990000
Some of the Bulgarians were persecuted in 1989,

1032
2:28:38,000000 --> 2:28:38,990000
and the local population, to see that they never talk about tourists. You did this to the people of Bulgaria.

1033
2:28:50,000000 --> 2:28:50,990000
This is not talked about.

1034
2:28:53,000000 --> 2:28:53,990000
I think many Bulgarians are surprised even to this day that they are not connected to this.

1035
2:28:58,000000 --> 2:28:58,990000
Yes, they are afraid, but the scary thing is that these things continue, in Bulgaria they continue.

1036
2:29:05,000000 --> 2:29:05,990000
I want to tell you something about the history.

1037
2:29:11,000000 --> 2:29:11,990000
When one of our friends from Belene, whom I know, who wrote a memoir,

1038
2:29:20,000000 --> 2:29:20,990000
writes in his memoir that after Belene he was born in Bogovdol, and then he went to a village there, near Bogovdol,

1039
2:29:26,000000 --> 2:29:26,990000
he went to live in a family there,

1040
2:29:31,000000 --> 2:29:31,990000
and in the morning, when he went downstairs,

1041
2:29:34,000000 --> 2:29:34,990000
and for the first time the child, because when he arrived it was late,

1042
2:29:37,000000 --> 2:29:37,990000
and the child had not seen him,

1043
2:29:40,000000 --> 2:29:40,990000
in the morning he arrived, his mother and father,

1044
2:29:43,000000 --> 2:29:43,990000
and he went downstairs, he said hello, and the boy said to his parents,

1045
2:29:48,000000 --> 2:29:48,990000
why he doesn't have a yatagan?

1046
2:29:52,000000 --> 2:29:52,990000
He knew that he had a name, he had grown up from his parents, that there was a Turkish man, that he would live in them,

1047
2:30:01,000000 --> 2:30:01,990000
and he expected to see a exact same thing from the history,

1048
2:30:06,000000 --> 2:30:06,990000
from what is written.

1049
2:30:08,000000 --> 2:30:08,990000
But to tell you about the fact that in today's history,

1050
2:30:13,000000 --> 2:30:13,990000
the purpose for children, even not for students,

1051
2:30:16,000000 --> 2:30:16,990000
for children until the school age, there are such terrible things, I just don't know how a person can fight this propaganda.

1052
2:30:30,000000 --> 2:30:30,990000
I will tell you a little bit about the good things.

1053
2:30:33,000000 --> 2:30:33,990000
And thanks to the efforts of the Foundation Truth and Memory with the President Christo Hristov,

1054
2:30:39,000000 --> 2:30:39,990000
a lot has been done to change some textbooks.

1055
2:30:43,000000 --> 2:30:43,990000
But I will tell you about one textbook, for example,

1056
2:30:46,000000 --> 2:30:46,990000
I learned about it last year, for the third class

1057
2:30:49,000000 --> 2:30:49,990000
– Man and Society.

1058
2:30:52,000000 --> 2:30:52,990000
The children of my brother-in-law are the only children

1059
2:30:55,000000 --> 2:30:55,990000
with a student name in the class.

1060
2:30:58,000000 --> 2:30:58,990000
And when they have a lesson, which is called

1061
2:31:02,000000 --> 2:31:02,990000
Bulgaria in the Ottoman Empire, all children begin to look at it, as she says,

1062
2:31:10,000000 --> 2:31:10,990000
with bloodshot eyes, like a man who has killed.

1063
2:31:16,000000 --> 2:31:16,990000
Because this period is summarized there and they think that this is an absolute literal summary of the novel

1064
2:31:27,000000 --> 2:31:27,990000
Time Separated.

1065
2:31:29,000000 --> 2:31:29,990000
This is an edition from 2021.

1066
2:31:34,000000 --> 2:31:34,990000
But let me tell you some good things that are not small.

1067
2:31:37,000000 --> 2:31:37,990000
The first years in Bulgaria were truly, from democracy, there were really many things,

1068
2:31:46,000000 --> 2:31:46,990000
and I can say that for all Bulgarian citizens

1069
2:31:53,000000 --> 2:31:53,990000
the expectations were much higher than what happened after that.

1070
2:32:00,000000 --> 2:32:00,990000
That is, the transition, no one thought that the transition would be so difficult, so slow, so difficult.

1071
2:32:08,840000 --> 2:32:47
But that's what happened and this difficult transition carries with it many such negative things, I am not talking about these stories here, but people have the freedom to move, to go wherever they want, or there are Turks, although for the Roma it is a little more difficult,

1072
2:32:47,000000 --> 2:32:47,990000
I think that for them the response is much better,

1073
2:32:52,000000 --> 2:32:52,990000
the best is for the Turks, then for the Roma and the most difficult for the Roma.

1074
2:32:58,000000 --> 2:32:58,990000
There are some restrictions in the university, in the attitude of people.

1075
2:33:09,000000 --> 2:33:09,990000
When you don't know the name, the attitude is different, when you hear the name, you are a little shocked.

1076
2:33:14,000000 --> 2:33:14,990000
I personally have seen it. And now I continue with the left, but not all of them, of course. Because I have so many friends and acquaintances,

1077
2:33:27,000000 --> 2:33:27,990000
with whom I always come with great desire.

1078
2:33:32,000000 --> 2:33:32,990000
For example, I can say that you also have many researches,

1079
2:33:36,000000 --> 2:33:36,990000
I would like to thank you personally here.

1080
2:33:39,000000 --> 2:33:39,990000
Colleagues from Blagoevgrad have been working for a long time on the Chiren project

1081
2:33:44,000000 --> 2:33:44,990000
and with documents for the National Sun Sim of the palm trees from the area.

1082
2:33:48,560000 --> 2:33:53,840000
And thanks to them and the assistance of the mayor of Gotse Djelchev,

1083
2:33:53,840000 --> 2:33:58,400000
for example, Vladimir Moskov, it became possible, unthinkably before,

1084
2:33:58,400000 --> 2:34:08
to hold a conference on the 50th anniversary of the Kornishkite Vesti and the publication of the magazine.

1085
2:34:08,000000 --> 2:34:08,990000
This was on November 18, 2023, when people could come and hear the reports on these issues.

1086
2:34:18,000000 --> 2:34:18,990000
So, there are really many changes, but there are still many things to be done.

1087
2:34:25,600000 --> 2:34:30,320000
I think that this should be achieved through joint efforts,

1088
2:34:30,320000 --> 2:34:37,760000
and especially with the leading role of the institutions, the public and the politicians.

1089
2:34:37,760000 --> 2:34:47
Of course, the biggest role is with the politicians, but unfortunately, the politicians always want to be concerned about their own interests

1090
2:34:47,000000 --> 2:34:47,990000
and usually things that society, the society of the child, does not allow themselves due to political crises, due to interests.

1091
2:34:59,000000 --> 2:34:59,990000
And many people suffer, as we say, many people do not know about these things.

1092
2:35:07,000000 --> 2:35:07,990000
Why did I tell you? It is very difficult for me, sometimes I can not stand it, because I experience these things again,

1093
2:35:15,000000 --> 2:35:15,990000
but I feel obliged to tell so that this will never happens again in Bulgaria.

1094
2:35:25,000000 --> 2:35:25,990000
Thank you, Professor Zefer. You are right, there is still a lot to be done,

1095
2:35:33,000000 --> 2:35:33,990000
both on television and in the public eye.

1096
2:35:36,000000 --> 2:35:36,990000
We want to give our modest contribution in this direction. Take our greetings from Sofia,

1097
2:35:48,000000 --> 2:35:48,990000
many greetings to Ankara,

1098
2:35:50,000000 --> 2:35:50,990000

1099
2:35:52,000000 --> 2:35:52,990000
who are watching our show.

1100

That was all for today.

1101
2:35:58,000000 --> 2:35:58,990000
That was all for today in

1102
2:36:00,000000 --> 2:36:00,990000
