0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
The And today my guest is Prof. Iskra Baeva, who is a professor at the University of philosophy,

2
0:00:29,520000 --> 0:00:37,320000
which studies modern European and Bulgarian history.

3
0:00:37,320000 --> 0:00:40,320000
Hello, Prof. Baeva, how are you?

4
0:00:40,320000 --> 0:00:59
Hello, I am fine. I hope your viewers are fine too. Dear God, Mrs. Barma, today we will discuss a topic that is painful for our society and this is the productive process.

5
0:00:59,000000 --> 0:00:59,990000
Tell me, who gave the idea to create this development process?

6
0:01:10,000000 --> 0:01:10,990000
First, maybe I should start a little bit later, in time, because the development process, maybe first I should clarify what the development process means. Since the creation of the Bulgarian state in 1878,

7
0:01:25,000000 --> 0:01:25,990000
a significant Turkish community has been living in it,

8
0:01:29,000000 --> 0:01:29,990000
as well as an Islamic community,

9
0:01:32,000000 --> 0:01:32,990000
that is, the Islamized Bulgarians,

10
0:01:35,000000 --> 0:01:35,990000
who are usually called Hamas or Bulgarian Muslims.

11
0:01:38,000000 --> 0:01:38,990000
And the Bulgarian state, since its creation,

12
0:01:42,000000 --> 0:01:42,990000
has had a problem with this community and it is looking for some forms,

13
0:01:46,000000 --> 0:01:46,990000
political forms,

14
0:01:48,000000 --> 0:01:48,990000
for their communication,

15
0:01:50,000000 --> 0:01:50,990000
assimilation, different forms.

16
0:01:52,000000 --> 0:01:52,990000
And

17
0:01:54,000000 --> 0:01:54,990000
thanks to this

18
0:01:56,000000 --> 0:01:56,990000
problem, this problem is connected

19
0:01:58,000000 --> 0:01:58,990000
with the wars that Bulgaria is leading,

20
0:02:00,000000 --> 0:02:00,990000
because one part of these

21
0:02:02,000000 --> 0:02:02,990000
wars, for example the Balkan Wars,

22
0:02:04,000000 --> 0:02:04,990000
the First Balkan War,

23
0:02:05,000000 --> 0:02:05,990000
was fought with the Ottoman Empire. During the First World War,

24
0:02:10,000000 --> 0:02:10,990000
Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were allies. So there are different forms.

25
0:02:15,000000 --> 0:02:15,990000
But anyway, the Bulgarian governments, throughout the period of the modern existence of the Bulgarian state,

26
0:02:22,000000 --> 0:02:22,990000
had a problem with what policy to introduce

27
0:02:26,000000 --> 0:02:26,990000
in relation to this population.

28
0:02:28,000000 --> 0:02:28,990000
After the Second World War, things, of course,

29
0:02:30,000000 --> 0:02:30,990000
have changed radically in every relationship,

30
0:02:32,000000 --> 0:02:32,990000
including in relation to the Turkish and Muslim population,

31
0:02:37,000000 --> 0:02:37,990000
because these are two groups that cover each other,

32
0:02:41,000000 --> 0:02:41,990000
but not completely.

33
0:02:43,000000 --> 0:02:43,990000
The Turkish and Muslim population, at the beginning of this period, after September 9,

34
0:02:50,220000 --> 0:02:53,880000
acts on a purely international basis.

35
0:02:53,880000 --> 0:03:02,720000
They communicate, they are given conditions for their social and economic development, cultural development.

36
0:03:02,720000 --> 0:03:07,680000
They receive cultural autonomy until the age of 50.

37
0:03:07,680000 --> 0:03:14,820000
In practice, they have cultural autonomy, they have a school, there are three specialties at the University of Sofia,

38
0:03:14,820000 --> 0:03:20,740000
which teaches the Turkish language, teachers are taught with them on these subjects.

39
0:03:20,740000 --> 0:03:26
It is about Turkish Philology, Turkish History the Turkish Mathematics at the University of Sofia.

40
0:03:26,000000 --> 0:03:26,990000
So this period from September 9 to mid-1950s and a little autonomy and the experience of their cultural education through the Bulgarian educational system.

41
0:03:55,000000 --> 0:03:55,990000
The Bulgarian educational system is being established, but at the same time various privileges are given to the education of Bulgarian education, to encourage them to enter high schools,

42
0:04:07,000000 --> 0:04:07,990000
especially universities and other universities,

43
0:04:11,000000 --> 0:04:11,990000
especially the teachers,

44
0:04:13,000000 --> 0:04:13,990000
to encourage them to access the Turkish and Muslim population

45
0:04:19,000000 --> 0:04:19,990000
in this pursuit of their education, creating more favorable conditions for their labor integration.

46
0:04:31,000000 --> 0:04:31,990000
Of course, there is still a doubt in the effectiveness of this settlement to the Bulgarian state.

47
0:04:38,000000 --> 0:04:38,990000
This is the reason why in the army they are not included as a general group, but to be in labor forces,

48
0:04:46,000000 --> 0:04:46,990000
meaning serving the military service not with weapons in hand, but through labor.

49
0:04:52,000000 --> 0:04:52,990000
In other words, this policy of, on the one hand, communicating, on the other hand,

50
0:04:57,000000 --> 0:04:57,990000
suspicion and the desire to be violent, in the end, change, has been happening throughout this period,

51
0:05:06,000000 --> 0:05:06,990000
with the accent being shifted in one direction.

52
0:05:10,000000 --> 0:05:10,990000
Also, it is worth mentioning

53
0:05:12,000000 --> 0:05:12,990000
another constant characteristic

54
0:05:14,000000 --> 0:05:14,990000
of the attitude of the Bulgarian state

55
0:05:16,000000 --> 0:05:16,990000
towards the Bulgarian Turks and the Bulgarian Muslims,

56
0:05:19,000000 --> 0:05:19,990000
and these are the solar waves.

57
0:05:23,000000 --> 0:05:23,990000
These solar waves are three times more in the Third Bulgarian kingdom with three of these waves.

58
0:05:28,000000 --> 0:05:28,990000
In the period after 1944, there are two waves.

59
0:05:32,000000 --> 0:05:32,990000
The first is in the year of 451.

60
0:05:35,000000 --> 0:05:35,990000
This is a significant wave.

61
0:05:37,000000 --> 0:05:37,990000
130,000 Bulgarian Turks, Muslims and the village are in this period.

62
0:05:42,000000 --> 0:05:42,990000
And finally, this wave has stopped

63
0:05:45,000000 --> 0:05:45,990000
from crossing the border with Turkey.

64
0:05:47,000000 --> 0:05:47,990000
It is caused by collectivization,

65
0:05:52,000000 --> 0:05:52,990000
by the cooperation of the land

66
0:05:54,000000 --> 0:05:54,990000
and it has economic characteristics,

67
0:05:56,000000 --> 0:05:56,990000
but the idea of the Bulgarian Turks

68
0:05:59,000000 --> 0:05:59,990000
to return to what is called the motherland,

69
0:06:02,000000 --> 0:06:02,990000
I would say to the Turks,

70
0:06:05,000000 --> 0:06:05,990000
because a significant part of this population is born,

71
0:06:09,000000 --> 0:06:09,990000
and not only that, his ancestors were born in Bulgaria,

72
0:06:13,000000 --> 0:06:13,990000
so the mother-mother is a more common concept.

73
0:06:18,000000 --> 0:06:18,990000
If we have to make a comparison,

74
0:06:20,000000 --> 0:06:20,990000
to make it clearer,

75
0:06:22,000000 --> 0:06:22,990000
this is similar to the attitude of the Bessarabians and other Bulgarians in Ukraine and Moldova

76
0:06:29,000000 --> 0:06:29,990000
has such great similarities to the motherland of Bulgaria,

77
0:06:33,000000 --> 0:06:33,990000
although several generations of Bulgarians lived and lived there.

78
0:06:39,000000 --> 0:06:39,990000
Of course, the situation is more different in Bulgaria,

79
0:06:42,000000 --> 0:06:42,990000
because the motherland of the Bulgarian Turks is on the border of Bulgaria.

80
0:06:48,000000 --> 0:06:48,990000
And besides all that, this is a country that for many centuries has conquered Bulgarian territories.

81
0:06:58,000000 --> 0:06:58,990000
And this is a big, strong country. The threats exist throughout the period. After the Second World War and especially after 1952-1953,

82
0:07:09,000000 --> 0:07:09,990000
these traditional threats are being added to the fact that

83
0:07:13,000000 --> 0:07:13,990000
from 1955 Bulgaria is a member of the Bolshevik League,

84
0:07:17,000000 --> 0:07:17,990000
and shortly before that Turkey is a member of NATO's North Atlantic Party.

85
0:07:23,000000 --> 0:07:23,990000
And so we are are divided into two sides

86
0:07:26,000000 --> 0:07:26,990000
of two military-political blocs

87
0:07:29,000000 --> 0:07:29,990000
who oppose each other.

88
0:07:32,000000 --> 0:07:32,990000
Things are not only internal-political,

89
0:07:35,000000 --> 0:07:35,990000
but also external-political.

90
0:07:38,000000 --> 0:07:38,990000
In this situation of these complex relations

91
0:07:41,000000 --> 0:07:41,990000
comes what we know as

92
0:07:44,000000 --> 0:07:44,990000
the imposition of violence of these complex relations, comes what we know as

93
0:07:46,000000 --> 0:07:46,990000
the first name, the name of the violence

94
0:07:49,000000 --> 0:07:49,990000
of the Bulgarian Roma or Gypsies, as you wish to call them.

95
0:07:52,000000 --> 0:07:52,990000
Then follows a process

96
0:07:55,000000 --> 0:07:55,990000
in the 70s, also the violence

97
0:07:58,000000 --> 0:07:58,990000
of the Bulgarian Muslims, the Comas.

98
0:08:01,000000 --> 0:08:01,990000
But all that I am saying

99
0:08:04,000000 --> 0:08:04,990000
is not a revolutionary process.

100
0:08:06,000000 --> 0:08:06,990000
This is the long way to the revolutionary process.

101
0:08:09,000000 --> 0:08:09,990000
The revolutionary process is called the large-scale action

102
0:08:14,000000 --> 0:08:14,990000
which the Bulgarian state undertook in the late 1984,

103
0:08:18,000000 --> 0:08:18,990000
from December 1984 to March 1985,

104
0:08:23,000000 --> 0:08:23,990000
within three and a half months,

105
0:08:26,000000 --> 0:08:26,990000
the name of about 850,000 Bulgarian citizens of the Turkish state was changed to Bulgarian. Bulgarian and not only Slavic, but also European names.

106
0:08:50,000000 --> 0:08:50,990000
This is called a production process because it has its own basis.

107
0:08:57,000000 --> 0:08:57,990000
That is why it is called a production process, because the basis is a group is not only Bulgarian historians, but also Bulgarian ethnologists,

108
0:09:06,400000 --> 0:09:12,400000
archaeologists, ethnologists, demographers.

109
0:09:12,400000 --> 0:09:20,400000
A group that claims, that creates a document, their own legislative process.

110
0:09:20,400000 --> 0:09:28
They work on it after the name is done, but this is the ideological basis of the process.

111
0:09:28,000000 --> 0:09:28,990000
According to their research, which is true, which in the Bulgarian state, which in the long years of Ottoman rule

112
0:09:48,440000 --> 0:10:26
was not only Islamized, but gradually lost its language and national identity. This thesis, and there is even another argument, one of the colleagues says that this population, these are the upper tribes, whose lands were conquered, and the opposition of these tribes remained suppressed over time.

113
0:10:26,000000 --> 0:10:26,990000
These tribes, the heirs of the tribes,

114
0:10:30,000000 --> 0:10:30,990000
more easily accepted not only Islam, but also the ethnic self-awareness of the new ruler of these lands, the Ottoman Empire.

115
0:10:39,000000 --> 0:10:39,990000
Of course, these are the ones that would be difficult to fully document.

116
0:10:47,760000 --> 0:10:57,160000
But I just explain the idea. The idea is that these 850,000, I repeat this number 850,000,

117
0:10:57,160000 --> 0:11:08
because there were, especially in the first years of the transition, incredible propaganda-based, in my opinion, that the Bulgarian Turks are

118
0:11:08,000000 --> 0:11:08,990000
million and a half, two million, one million and a half, but this absolutely does not convince me,

119
0:11:12,000000 --> 0:11:12,990000
they are 850 thousand or in other words, they are somehow under 10% of the Bulgarian population and

120
0:11:20,000000 --> 0:11:20,990000
despite this, they seem dangerous. In fact, this is the motivation for the attempt to solve this issue through national renaming seems dangerous.

121
0:11:29,000000 --> 0:11:29,990000
The population of this region is higher than that of the Bulgarians.

122
0:11:34,000000 --> 0:11:34,990000
I have seen diagrams that in the future, until the beginning of the 21st century, this population can even exceed the Bulgarian population.

123
0:11:49,600000 --> 0:11:53,600000
Now, first of all, how much of this explanation can be accepted?

124
0:11:53,600000 --> 0:12:01,600000
It is difficult to accept, because the Islamized Bulgarians preserve their language and their ethnic consciousness.

125
0:12:01,600000 --> 0:12:05
And it is difficult to explain why some people keep it,

126
0:12:05,000000 --> 0:12:05,990000
and others, the larger part, do not keep it.

127
0:12:08,000000 --> 0:12:08,990000
I think that there is no doubt among Bulgarian historians

128
0:12:12,000000 --> 0:12:12,990000
that it is about Turks who, after the liberation of Bulgaria,

129
0:12:16,000000 --> 0:12:16,990000
have not occupied Bulgarian lands, they have stayed.

130
0:12:19,000000 --> 0:12:19,990000
And I must say that they have stayed among those who have no reason to fear.

131
0:12:24,000000 --> 0:12:24,990000
These are not the ruling Turks,

132
0:12:27,220000 --> 0:12:32,100000
these are the poor Turks who live in villages, mainly in mountainous and sub-lake areas,

133
0:12:32,100000 --> 0:12:40,260000
who live like the Bulgarians and who have no motive to leave the Bulgarian lands and go to the Ottoman Empire.

134
0:12:40,260000 --> 0:12:46
So, up and down, this is what things look like upside down, before this decision is taken.

135
0:12:46,000000 --> 0:12:46,990000
This decision is very strange, but it is not in the documentation.

136
0:12:51,000000 --> 0:12:51,990000
We have seen, not only us, but also a number of other researchers.

137
0:12:55,000000 --> 0:12:55,990000
We have seen two thick tones of 500 pages each, with documents on the development process.

138
0:13:02,000000 --> 0:13:02,990000
We have seen all the documents of the Central Committee of the State Archives, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Archives.

139
0:13:12,000000 --> 0:13:12,990000
The other investigators have not found a document in which to make a suggest that this action should be carried out in a strange way.

140
0:13:28,000000 --> 0:13:28,990000
First, in December in Krdjali, where Georgi Tannis, the Secretary of the Circle Committee of the BKP, launches this campaign by naming the Turks in the Krizhalinski district

141
0:13:48,000000 --> 0:13:48,990000
and sent some reports to the Central Committee, which reported the operation.

142
0:13:55,000000 --> 0:13:55,990000
The naming went very well, the population met the change of names with Rado, with Khora, are some data that we can hardly confirm,

143
0:14:09,000000 --> 0:14:09,990000
we can hardly agree with them.

144
0:14:11,000000 --> 0:14:11,990000
But anyway, these information, how easily we have passed this,

145
0:14:18,000000 --> 0:14:18,990000
are probably the reason for this process should continue in North-Eastern Bulgaria,

146
0:14:25,000000 --> 0:14:25,990000
because this is happening in the late 1984 and early 1985,

147
0:14:34,000000 --> 0:14:34,990000
and the rest of the Bulgarian Turks are in the early 1985.

148
0:14:41,000000 --> 0:14:41,990000
The decision of the Central Committee is not to carry out the change, but to approve it after the process was carried out.

149
0:14:53,000000 --> 0:14:53,990000
This process is very strange, because it was in 1984-1985. Ten years earlier, in the first of August, 1975, the final act of the Council on the Security of Europe was signature in this document. According to this document, not only the separation of Europe is resolved,

150
0:15:29,000000 --> 0:15:29,990000
not only the organization of the Union of Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE, is created,

151
0:15:35,000000 --> 0:15:35,990000
then the OSCE Council of the Union of Cooperation,

152
0:15:39,000000 --> 0:15:39,990000
but there are three main directions towards the agreement. The first is a political agreement for the improvement of the political opposition,

153
0:15:50,000000 --> 0:15:50,990000
the second is economic, again.

154
0:15:52,000000 --> 0:15:52,990000
The third, however, is for human rights, for the freedom of movement of people,

155
0:15:57,000000 --> 0:15:57,990000
for the freedom of movement of ideas.

156
0:15:59,000000 --> 0:15:59,990000
In it, the essential element is the preservation of human rights and civil rights.

157
0:16:05,760000 --> 0:16:15,360000
Ten years later, such a drastic violation of human rights is really very strange.

158
0:16:15,360000 --> 0:16:25
My explanation is that the end of his life, claimed that the development process is what will remain.

159
0:16:25,000000 --> 0:16:25,990000
This is his historical mission, his historical contribution to the history of Bulgaria,

160
0:16:30,000000 --> 0:16:30,990000
because according to him, the development process will lead to the creation of a single Bulgarian nation.

161
0:16:37,000000 --> 0:16:37,990000
This is what he calls the result of the development. A single Bulgarian nation. The reason to do so at that time

162
0:16:46,000000 --> 0:16:46,990000
is, in my opinion, the fact that

163
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
in the early 80s Bulgaria was a

164
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
very bad image in Europe and the world.

165
0:16:58,000000 --> 0:16:58,990000
It was a series of divisions

166
0:17:01,000000 --> 0:17:01,990000
in international relations,

167
0:17:03,000000 --> 0:17:03,990000
which, apart from the practice that really exists,

168
0:17:07,000000 --> 0:17:07,990000
are also due to the fact that at this time this is the administration of President Ronald Reagan of the United States,

169
0:17:15,000000 --> 0:17:15,990000
which adopts the policy of so-called differentiated relations in relation to that the Eastern bloc, the countries from the Eastern bloc,

170
0:17:27,000000 --> 0:17:27,990000
the United States, adopt a differentiated policy.

171
0:17:30,000000 --> 0:17:30,990000
In those countries that are most likely to implement reforms and are moving away from the Soviet Union,

172
0:17:36,000000 --> 0:17:36,990000
their policy is to be well-intentioned, to create economic and cultural and political ties,

173
0:17:46,000000 --> 0:17:46,990000
or, in other words, attracting them to the West.

174
0:17:49,000000 --> 0:17:49,990000
While these countries, which are loyal allies of the Soviet Union,

175
0:17:53,000000 --> 0:17:53,990000
they are being attacked in every way.

176
0:17:56,000000 --> 0:17:56,990000
They are being attacked more than the Soviet Union itself.

177
0:17:59,000000 --> 0:17:59,990000
Because the Soviet Union is a big and powerful country,

178
0:18:01,000000 --> 0:18:01,990000
and it is difficult for it to be attacked,

179
0:18:03,000000 --> 0:18:03,990000
Bulgaria plays the role of a testimony of what happens to these countries that are close to the Soviet Union.

180
0:18:12,160000 --> 0:18:20,600000
They attack in every way. There is, of course, a reason for this in the murder of George Markov,

181
0:18:20,600000 --> 0:18:25
of the writer George Markov in London, on the bridge of Waterloo.

182
0:18:25,000000 --> 0:18:25,990000
A murder that is still not fully revealed,

183
0:18:28,000000 --> 0:18:28,990000
so I will not be silent.

184
0:18:30,000000 --> 0:18:30,990000
The accusation against Bulgaria

185
0:18:32,000000 --> 0:18:32,990000
that it is engaged in trade with the enemy,

186
0:18:36,000000 --> 0:18:36,990000
as it was then called,

187
0:18:38,000000 --> 0:18:38,990000
for terrorist organizations,

188
0:18:40,000000 --> 0:18:40,990000
only that terrorist organizations in the United States

189
0:18:43,000000 --> 0:18:43,990000
then called national security movements in Africa and Latin America.

190
0:18:50,000000 --> 0:18:50,990000
These arms sales are faster for such movements, for the government, and so on. in drug trafficking, you have the Cptagon, these are such chemical-made drugs,

191
0:19:12,000000 --> 0:19:12,990000
not exactly drugs, then the so-called Puglarska Sreda was born,

192
0:19:21,000000 --> 0:19:21,990000
in the attempt to kill, the relationship between Pope John Paul II,

193
0:19:27,000000 --> 0:19:27,990000
which I hope everyone knows is already established by the United States

194
0:19:32,000000 --> 0:19:32,990000
in order to be a threat to Bulgaria.

195
0:19:34,000000 --> 0:19:34,990000
And so the image of Bulgaria and the attitude of the West to Bulgaria is so bad

196
0:19:39,000000 --> 0:19:39,990000
that probably Todor Zhivkov decided that in this situation he could do something even worse,

197
0:19:44,000000 --> 0:19:44,990000
because he had no way to silence the additional relationship and he decided that in this situation he could do something even worse,

198
0:19:45,000000 --> 0:19:45,990000
because he had no way of committing additional crimes.

199
0:19:47,000000 --> 0:19:47,990000
He took this inexplicable action for this period, at least for the 80s,

200
0:19:54,000000 --> 0:19:54,990000
of such a drastic violation of the rights of Bulgarian citizens and Turkish origin.

201
0:20:01,000000 --> 0:20:01,990000
A violent change of name.

202
0:20:03,000000 --> 0:20:03,990000
Many times after that, the country is attacked, questions are asked.

203
0:20:09,000000 --> 0:20:09,990000
The thesis of Bulgaria is that they voluntarily changed their names,

204
0:20:13,000000 --> 0:20:13,990000
and the Western senators say that it is possible to immediately

205
0:20:16,000000 --> 0:20:16,990000
850,000 people to ask to change their names.

206
0:20:19,000000 --> 0:20:19,990000
You understand, the thesis is very strange. But this action, as I said, is extremely large, 850,000.

207
0:20:31,000000 --> 0:20:31,990000
In fact, there are very serious consequences, all-territorial consequences, for Bulgaria, for the Bulgarian society,

208
0:20:38,000000 --> 0:20:38,990000
for the Bulgarian economy, for the relations with other Balkan countries, for the relations with the allies of the Warsaw Pact,

209
0:20:46,000000 --> 0:20:46,990000
even if they want to have relations with the Soviet Union,

210
0:20:50,000000 --> 0:20:50,990000
because we should not forget that when the action was taken in late 1984, in 1985,

211
0:20:57,000000 --> 0:20:57,990000
the Soviet Union, the beginning of the Soviet Union, was Konstantin Chernenko, who is in such a state of emergency that there is no way to deal with what is happening in the Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc.

212
0:21:15,000000 --> 0:21:15,990000
But during March-March 1985, he was the head of the National Security Council, which has a completely different point of view on the location and role of the Eastern bloc and the Soviet Union in the world,

213
0:21:26,000000 --> 0:21:26,990000
and which, for whom the Bulgarian electoral process is a big problem,

214
0:21:32,000000 --> 0:21:32,990000
because Gorbachev is for the improvement of the opposition, for the establishment, for the preservation of human rights,

215
0:21:40,000000 --> 0:21:40,990000
and suddenly, in some way, you have to defend the Union of Bulgaria, in which these rights are a drastic violation.

216
0:21:46,760000 --> 0:21:54,840000
This additionally creates a problem for the Bulgarian leadership, even with the Soviet Union.

217
0:21:54,840000 --> 0:21:58,120000
We can talk a lot about what happens.

218
0:21:58,120000 --> 0:22:05,500000
I have to remind you that the development process begins in 1984, the beginning of 1985.

219
0:22:05,500000 --> 0:22:09,100000
It continues until the summer of 1989.

220
0:22:09,100000 --> 0:22:13,300000
Usually, in the public consciousness, when the development process is said,

221
0:22:13,300000 --> 0:22:18,600000
everyone thinks that it is about the summer of 1989, but that is not the case.

222
0:22:18,600000 --> 0:22:24,400000
It continues for another four years before it ends.

223
0:22:24,400000 --> 0:22:29,600000
And it has its development,, of course, its end in 1989,

224
0:22:29,600000 --> 0:22:33,360000
in the course of the general changes that took place in the Eastern Bloc,

225
0:22:33,360000 --> 0:22:36,360000
which is a little later in Bulgaria, but they are real.

226
0:22:36,360000 --> 0:22:39,360000
Among them are Konstantin Trenchev and Ahmed Dogan,

227
0:22:39,360000 --> 0:22:43,120000
who claim that not only with the development process,

228
0:22:43,120000 --> 0:22:47
but also with what they call a big excursion with the settlement of the

229
0:22:47,000000 --> 0:22:47,990000
established president of 1989, they actually helped to take away the I have to ask, because a few days ago I watched an interview of Mr. Osman Oktay,

230
0:23:10,000000 --> 0:23:10,990000
who was a former deputy chairman of the DPR.

231
0:23:16,000000 --> 0:23:16,990000
He has information that the reproductive care process started from KGB?

232
0:23:30,000000 --> 0:23:30,990000
No, this is not true.

233
0:23:32,000000 --> 0:23:32,990000
Because KGB, as you said, has nothing in common with us.

234
0:23:37,000000 --> 0:23:37,990000
The way in which the Soviet Union solves its problems with its Islamic citizens,

235
0:23:43,000000 --> 0:23:43,990000
there are many Islamic republics,

236
0:23:45,000000 --> 0:23:45,990000
which are such Islamic, is completely different.

237
0:23:49,000000 --> 0:23:49,990000
It is more likely the opposite, more likely Todor Zhivkov is trying to show the Soviet Union

238
0:23:55,000000 --> 0:23:55,990000
how one of the ways of solving this problem can be solved.

239
0:23:59,000000 --> 0:23:59,990000
And, as I told you, he started it with Chernenko and does not expect that at the beginning of the Soviet Union a person with completely different views would soon come,

240
0:24:09,000000 --> 0:24:09,990000
so there is nothing in common with the NKGB.

241
0:24:11,000000 --> 0:24:11,990000
Even more so, for the Soviet Union, this campaign presents a problem in all respects.

242
0:24:18,000000 --> 0:24:18,990000
And in the conversations that the association has with Mikhail Gorbachev, he asked all of them to help in the Soviet Union in the fight against the relations between Bulgaria and Turkey,

243
0:24:31,000000 --> 0:24:31,990000
in the fight against the international attacks that are against Bulgaria.

244
0:24:36,000000 --> 0:24:36,990000
Gorbachev agreed, but half of the time, and in all casesian society there is a belief that everything bad comes from the HGB after the state security, but at least the historical documents and the historical pathology do not show it in this case categorically. But they have started to change their Turkish names, their Bulgarian names,

245
0:25:13,000000 --> 0:25:13,990000
and they have started to say that the protests are state security planning to raise the riots?

246
0:25:28,000000 --> 0:25:28,990000
The decision is political, but of course the state security is experiencing a serious loss in connection with the European Union,

247
0:25:47,000000 --> 0:25:47,990000
because the role of state security is to monitor the mood of the Bulgarian society.

248
0:25:54,000000 --> 0:25:54,990000
It is paying special attention to the Bulgarian Turks throughout the whole time.

249
0:25:59,000000 --> 0:25:59,990000
It pays special attention because, as I said at the beginning, the Bulgarian Turks have a Turkish state on the border with Bulgaria.

250
0:26:08,000000 --> 0:26:08,990000
There are, of course, proven links between the Turkish special services with the Bulgarian Turks and their organizations in Bulgaria.

251
0:26:16,000000 --> 0:26:16,990000
And for this reason, the state has many employees, so to speak, the Turkish population.

252
0:26:23,000000 --> 0:26:23,990000
Ahmed Dogan is one of them, Osman Oktay is another of them. The because the state security documents were unsecreted.

253
0:26:45,000000 --> 0:26:45,990000
But what happens with state security follows the process of implementation.

254
0:26:51,000000 --> 0:26:51,990000
I have read this in the state security documents.

255
0:26:55,000000 --> 0:26:55,990000
They are very saddened by the fact that their mass employees in this community,

256
0:27:03,000000 --> 0:27:03,990000
the Svastava Community, refuse to cooperate with the State,

257
0:27:06,000000 --> 0:27:06,990000
certainly because they feel terribly offended.

258
0:27:08,000000 --> 0:27:08,990000
Ahmed Dogan is one of them.

259
0:27:10,000000 --> 0:27:10,990000
They feel terribly offended.

260
0:27:12,000000 --> 0:27:12,990000
They say, we worked for this country, we are not loyal to this country,

261
0:27:16,000000 --> 0:27:16,990000
but look what you did to us.

262
0:27:18,000000 --> 0:27:18,990000
You forced us to change our names without warning us. without any warning, and there is a mass of people who remain without an informant or a partner in this community.

263
0:27:34,000000 --> 0:27:34,990000
What is the opposite? Yes, it exists even before the process of naming, then the first victims were given, there were about ten of them

264
0:27:46,000000 --> 0:27:46,990000
in this opposition.

265
0:27:48,000000 --> 0:27:48,990000
It is also true that

266
0:27:50,000000 --> 0:27:50,990000
the action is so large-scale

267
0:27:52,000000 --> 0:27:52,990000
that the participation of the army is imposed,

268
0:27:54,000000 --> 0:27:54,990000
not only on the domestic security,

269
0:27:56,000000 --> 0:27:56,990000
not only on the internal ones,

270
0:27:58,000000 --> 0:27:58,990000
but also on the army in the implementation

271
0:28:00,000000 --> 0:28:00,990000
of this action.

272
0:28:02,000000 --> 0:28:02,990000
It is also true, however, that the state

273
0:28:04,000000 --> 0:28:04,990000
manages to take all the documents of this population in a very short period of time, three months, which requires administrative potential.

274
0:28:13,000000 --> 0:28:13,990000
It must be said, especially from today's point of view, that for bad. But then, after that, illegal Turkish organizations began to be created,

275
0:28:31,000000 --> 0:28:31,990000
which resisted the pre-trial trial.

276
0:28:34,000000 --> 0:28:34,990000
Now, here I have to say that the first bomb attacks were carried out before the trial,

277
0:28:39,000000 --> 0:28:39,990000
they are in August 1984, so it is obvious that such a complaint had a pre-requirement.

278
0:28:45,000000 --> 0:28:45,990000
Then, however, a list of non-legal organizations was created, the most famous of which is the

279
0:28:51,000000 --> 0:28:51,990000
Turkish National Freedom Movement in Bulgaria, which in turn refers to Ahmed Dogan as one of the most prominent Turks in the Bulgarian state,

280
0:29:06,000000 --> 0:29:06,990000
because he completed his philosophy,

281
0:29:08,000000 --> 0:29:08,990000
he is a doctorate, an aspirant to the University of Sofia,

282
0:29:12,000000 --> 0:29:12,990000
he writes a dissertation and offers him to write the program of the party,

283
0:29:18,000000 --> 0:29:18,990000
of this organization, the Bulgarian National Association of the Movement,

284
0:29:22,000000 --> 0:29:22,990000
he does it and in this organization was discovered very quickly

285
0:29:26,880000 --> 0:29:34,240000
and he was sentenced by the process for the organization of the Bulgarian National Liberation Movement.

286
0:29:34,240000 --> 0:29:35,840000
He was sentenced and he was put in prison.

287
0:29:35,840000 --> 0:29:39,040000
He left the prison immediately after the changes.

288
0:29:39,040000 --> 0:30:09
But seeing the prison, he responded responded and sent a message. One of these messages from May 1989 was to ask the Bulgarian state's desire to free itself from its population,

289
0:30:09,000000 --> 0:30:09,990000
but also its own desire to leave for Turkey.

290
0:30:13,000000 --> 0:30:13,990000
So, state security,

291
0:30:25,880000 --> 0:30:31,560000
the development process also caused damage to this type of activity,

292
0:30:31,560000 --> 0:30:34,040000
to the network of employees.

293
0:30:34,040000 --> 0:30:51
Is there a connection between the attacks in Bolnovo, in the airport, in Varna, with the development process.

294
0:30:51,000000 --> 0:30:51,990000
Of course, there is no doubt.

295
0:30:54,000000 --> 0:30:54,990000
Still, these attempts were made by the Turks with the view of being a damaged Bulgarian state,

296
0:31:02,000000 --> 0:31:02,990000
because it violates their rights.

297
0:31:05,000000 --> 0:31:05,990000
But as I said before, this started even before that, before the development process.

298
0:31:09,000000 --> 0:31:09,990000
Or in other words, this opposition of the Bulgarians and the Turks started even before that.

299
0:31:13,000000 --> 0:31:13,990000
This is a long process.

300
0:31:15,000000 --> 0:31:15,990000
In fact, it started with a campaign to rename the children of mixed families.

301
0:31:22,000000 --> 0:31:22,990000
A family between Bulgarians and Turksic or Turkish and Bulgarian,

302
0:31:26,000000 --> 0:31:26,990000
in which up to that point the children's names were freely chosen

303
0:31:29,000000 --> 0:31:29,990000
and some kept their names.

304
0:31:31,000000 --> 0:31:31,990000
First, the renaming with these mixed families began.

305
0:31:36,000000 --> 0:31:36,990000
And then there was this reaction,

306
0:31:38,000000 --> 0:31:38,990000
and then the preparation of these bomb attacks began.

307
0:31:43,000000 --> 0:31:43,990000
So yes, the campaign is a drastic violation of the rights of the Bulgarian Turks,

308
0:31:53,000000 --> 0:31:53,990000
they have a free choice, but they also correspond with the campaign,

309
0:31:58,000000 --> 0:31:58,990000
with the attempt to be punished by part of the Bulgarian population, which is a certain term for terrorism,

310
0:32:10,000000 --> 0:32:10,990000
because there is terrorism when your action is not directed at your enemy,

311
0:32:17,000000 --> 0:32:17,990000
but at foreign victims, to innocent citizens, with the aim of achieving their goal from their opponent. These bombings and these organizations are aimed at the Bulgarian state,

312
0:32:30,760000 --> 0:32:34,760000
but the bombings are aimed at innocent citizens.

313
0:32:34,760000 --> 0:32:38,760000
You know, the carriages are full of mothers and daughters who have no fault,

314
0:32:38,760000 --> 0:32:46
but this is what happens in such big crisis processes as a re-establishment process.

315
0:32:46,000000 --> 0:32:46,990000
And according to the services, who are the organizers of the May events?

316
0:32:59,000000 --> 0:32:59,990000
The May protests are a new stage, actually this is the final stage of the development process,

317
0:33:06,000000 --> 0:33:06,990000
because then, you know, for these four years of the development process, at first there is a counterattack,

318
0:33:13,000000 --> 0:33:13,990000
then things calm down and the last stage of state security begins in the Turkish environment,

319
0:33:21,000000 --> 0:33:21,990000
to organize this, to build farms, to build new houses.

320
0:33:25,000000 --> 0:33:25,990000
In other words, the Bulgarian Turks are reconciling.

321
0:33:30,000000 --> 0:33:30,990000
This is the state-owned company at the same time, especially in the later years,

322
0:33:34,000000 --> 0:33:34,990000
that the Turks live a war life.

323
0:33:37,000000 --> 0:33:37,990000
On the one hand, they officially have Bulgarian names,

324
0:33:40,000000 --> 0:33:40,990000
they dress in non-traditional clothes, but uno in their homes, they use their old names.

325
0:33:48,000000 --> 0:33:48,990000
But since there is a peace-making, a adjustment to the situation, things change in the early 1989,

326
0:33:57,000000 --> 0:33:57,990000
because then, within the framework of this process, which you talked about a little,

327
0:34:02,000000 --> 0:34:02,990000
the Council of the Security and Security of Europe, a series of conferences are held.

328
0:34:07,000000 --> 0:34:07,990000
The last one, from the year 1989 in Paris, is on human rights, on human rights.

329
0:34:13,000000 --> 0:34:13,990000
And before this conference, it was decided that all citizens of European countries

330
0:34:20,000000 --> 0:34:20,990000
should receive a passport and have the right to travel outside the borders, to return.

331
0:34:25,000000 --> 0:34:25,990000
In other words, Bulgaria, which is part of this process, is forced to give a passport to all its citizens.

332
0:34:33,000000 --> 0:34:33,990000
And this gives the perspective for the Bulgarian Turks that they are not doomed to live in Bulgaria

333
0:34:40,000000 --> 0:34:40,990000
and that they are not doomed and accept what has happened. At this moment, it should be said that there are also political factors,

334
0:34:51,000000 --> 0:34:51,990000
unofficial political factors, so to speak,

335
0:34:55,000000 --> 0:34:55,990000
from one side the dissident movement, which was created in 1988

336
0:34:59,000000 --> 0:34:59,990000
and in the beginning of 1989 this organization,

337
0:35:03,000000 --> 0:35:03,990000
the Club for Supporting the the Voice and the Development of Bulgaria was already existing,

338
0:35:07,000000 --> 0:35:07,990000
which tried to unite the small presidential organization of the state and which came out with such a declaration of protection of the rights of citizens,

339
0:35:16,000000 --> 0:35:16,990000
which in the spring of 1989 came out with a signature, which 130 people, intellectuals sign, in which the signature, submitted to the National Assembly,

340
0:35:28,000000 --> 0:35:28,990000
demands that the right of Bulgarians to choose their names.

341
0:35:32,000000 --> 0:35:32,990000
They support the Bulgarian Turks.

342
0:35:36,000000 --> 0:35:36,990000
On the other hand, as Ahmed Dogan said,

343
0:35:40,000000 --> 0:35:40,990000
he manages to send a letter from the prison,

344
0:35:43,000000 --> 0:35:43,990000
in which there are five points, with which he made the organizational processes that are related to the Bulgarian Turks.

345
0:35:52,000000 --> 0:35:52,990000
The request, of course, was to return to the right, but one of these requests is free movement,

346
0:35:57,000000 --> 0:35:57,990000
that is, the right to settle in Turkey.

347
0:35:59,000000 --> 0:35:59,990000
And so, in the course of this process, this whole process of transformation in Europe and the world, especially in the Eastern Bloc,

348
0:36:08,880000 --> 0:36:19,520000
in the end, the Turks feel supported by the Bulgarian dissidents, by them themselves, by external factors,

349
0:36:19,520000 --> 0:36:26
because this was a campaign, you are from another generation, you don't remember, but I am from the generation that remembers well,

350
0:36:26,000000 --> 0:36:26,990000
a big campaign in the Western radio stations in support of the Bulgarian Turks.

351
0:36:34,000000 --> 0:36:34,990000
And in the course of these changes that are taking place in the development process,

352
0:36:39,000000 --> 0:36:39,990000
the new organizations are emerging, which are organized by the Turks, who are in power.

353
0:36:45,000000 --> 0:36:45,990000
New human rights activists are also in May protests.

354
0:36:51,000000 --> 0:36:51,990000
There are major fights among the Turks, demanding to return their names.

355
0:36:57,000000 --> 0:36:57,990000
The issue of the names of Bulgar Bulgarian Turks was raised a lot.

356
0:37:05,000000 --> 0:37:05,990000
And then, in the end, the decision was taken by many of the associations,

357
0:37:09,000000 --> 0:37:09,990000
which on May 29, 1989, came out with a message on the only radio then,

358
0:37:17,000000 --> 0:37:17,990000
the only television then, in which it says that all Bulgarian citizens will receive a passport, that they can travel to other countries and then return.

359
0:37:30,000000 --> 0:37:30,990000
It is exactly this emptiness.

360
0:37:32,000000 --> 0:37:32,990000
At the same time, I urge them not to forget that the graves of their ancestors,

361
0:37:38,000000 --> 0:37:38,990000
their ancestors, the devils and the bad guys, are in Bulgaria,

362
0:37:40,000000 --> 0:37:40,990000
that they are Bulgarian citizens.

363
0:37:42,000000 --> 0:37:42,990000
And with this, in fact, the final stage began,

364
0:37:48,000000 --> 0:37:48,990000
not only the preparation of the Turkish community for the mass release of Bulgaria,

365
0:37:53,000000 --> 0:37:53,990000
but in fact this is the end of the revolutionary process,

366
0:37:56,000000 --> 0:37:56,990000
because, as I will remind you, the revolutionary process is trying to convince the Bulgarian Turks

367
0:38:01,000000 --> 0:38:01,990000
that they are Bulgarians in the past, with a darkened national consciousness,

368
0:38:06,000000 --> 0:38:06,990000
with a dim national consciousness that they are actually Bulgarians.

369
0:38:10,000000 --> 0:38:10,990000
But at the moment when Togor Zhivko says that you can go to Turkey somewhere else,

370
0:38:17,000000 --> 0:38:17,990000
it means that he has abandoned this basic phase of the development process.

371
0:38:21,000000 --> 0:38:21,990000
But here, on May 23, we May, the end of this development process is followed, which is declared to be a record.

372
0:38:29,000000 --> 0:38:29,990000
Yes!

373
0:38:31,000000 --> 0:38:31,990000
With this speech of Todor Zhitko on the radio and on television, in practice, the end of the development process is set, because he admits, Todor Zhitko admits that these are Bulgarian Turks. And what he did was to call them to leave, but then to call them back, because they are Bulgarian citizens.

374
0:38:53,000000 --> 0:38:53,990000
In practice, however, what happens is that on the one active people in the Turkish community.

375
0:39:09,000000 --> 0:39:09,990000
They directly expel them from Bulgaria to Vienna with planes.

376
0:39:13,000000 --> 0:39:13,990000
These are mostly those who are locked up in a new camp in Belene for dangerous elements. But besides that, they also have the idea to leave Bulgaria to 150,000 Bulgarian Turks,

377
0:39:28,000000 --> 0:39:28,990000
so that the normal relationship can be restored.

378
0:39:35,000000 --> 0:39:35,990000
About 150,000 are the settlement of the Volnovs,

379
0:39:40,000000 --> 0:39:40,990000
49-51st year, if we need to make a parallel. But instead, the organization of the Turkish community itself is very massive

380
0:39:50,000000 --> 0:39:50,990000
and there is a preparation for the expulsion of 350,000 people.

381
0:39:56,000000 --> 0:39:56,990000
This means that they must, in addition to receiving passports,

382
0:40:02,000000 --> 0:40:02,990000
because although the refugee visa only goes an excursion to return, they are actually always going to leave.

383
0:40:09,000000 --> 0:40:09,990000
Because they sell houses, they save their money from the State Security, sorry, from the State Special Bank. The economists who have been involved in this process, even shared that it is amazing how the Bulgarian banking system has managed to withdraw so much money,

384
0:40:31,000000 --> 0:40:31,990000
because the Bulgarian Turks who deal mainly with the rural development have large in the second half of August, the Turkish state stopped the expelling and the expelling of 350,000 people.

385
0:40:53,240000 --> 0:41:00,720000
And a group was formed, which in fact, the tragedy of these people is perhaps the biggest, because they have already sold their property,

386
0:41:00,720000 --> 0:41:08
they have climbed, they have reached the border and suddenly the border is closed and they stayed on the Bulgarian side of the border,

387
0:41:08,000000 --> 0:41:08,990000
but there was nowhere to go back.

388
0:41:10,000000 --> 0:41:10,990000
The tragedy is really huge.

389
0:41:12,000000 --> 0:41:12,990000
It leads to the isolation of relations between Bulgaria and Turkey.

390
0:41:17,000000 --> 0:41:17,990000
In Bulgaria there are nationalistic rallies that threaten Bulgaria for this policy.

391
0:41:27,000000 --> 0:41:27,990000
This continues until the withdrawal of the government from power.

392
0:41:32,000000 --> 0:41:32,990000
I should also say that even before the withdrawal of the government from power on 10 November,

393
0:41:38,000000 --> 0:41:38,990000
there was a disappointment among the Bulgarian Turks who had settled for Turkey.

394
0:41:43,000000 --> 0:41:43,990000
About 90,000 of them returned to Bulgaria,

395
0:41:45,340000 --> 0:41:48,800000
dissatisfied with the conditions that the Turkish state offered them.

396
0:41:48,800000 --> 0:41:52,960000
With the withdrawal of Todor Zhivkov, things changed radically,

397
0:41:52,960000 --> 0:41:59,500000
because the BKP itself, which has withdrawn Todor Zhivkov,

398
0:41:59,500000 --> 0:42:07
admits that this legislative process is a crime against the civil rights of the Bulgarian Turks.

399
0:42:07,000000 --> 0:42:07,990000
And finally, on December 29, 1989, the Central Committee of the BKP took the decision to cancel the process

400
0:42:18,000000 --> 0:42:18,990000
by returning the names of the Bulgarian Turks.

401
0:42:21,000000 --> 0:42:21,990000
This decision was approved for the first time by the opposition that had started between the BKP and the new political forces.

402
0:42:28,000000 --> 0:42:28,990000
It was approved by the GELO-GELO, the CDS members, but at the same time it was a dissatisfaction with the Bulgarians from mixed regions.

403
0:42:37,000000 --> 0:42:37,990000
Razgrad, Kyrgyzstan, even something like the Republic of Razgrad was announced, which said that they would not agree with the return of the names of the Turks.

404
0:42:49,000000 --> 0:42:49,990000
Of course, this decision was taken from her, it was turned into state policy by Georgi Atanasov,

405
0:42:56,000000 --> 0:42:56,990000
who is now the Minister-President.

406
0:42:58,000000 --> 0:42:58,990000
But this decision in practice, first in the legislative process and after the return of the names,

407
0:43:04,000000 --> 0:43:04,990000
in practice creates conditions for something new in Bulgarian politics,

408
0:43:08,000000 --> 0:43:08,990000
which did not exist before, namely the creation of a political party of Bulgarian forces,

409
0:43:13,000000 --> 0:43:13,990000
that is, a DPC.

410
0:43:15,000000 --> 0:43:15,990000
There was no such thing in modern Bulgarian history.

411
0:43:18,000000 --> 0:43:18,990000
There was an organization, there were attempts for a toran,

412
0:43:21,000000 --> 0:43:21,990000
there was, as they say, the Bulgarian Nationalation Movement Bulgaria, but there was no political party.

413
0:43:27,000000 --> 0:43:27,990000
It was created in January, the beginning of January 1990 and as we know, it is still existing today with a lot of good organizational and political success. One last question to ask you. Why in the pre-election campaign DPS continues to say to the villages that if not DPS, They will rename their names again and scare people.

414
0:44:09,000000 --> 0:44:09,990000
They will do it.

415
0:44:12,000000 --> 0:44:12,990000
This is political propaganda, as you know, because when you have political parties, they protect their interests.

416
0:44:18,000000 --> 0:44:18,990000
There is another myth that is spreading in the DPC, that our ethnic myth in Bulgaria was saved by Ahmed Dogan.

417
0:44:26,000000 --> 0:44:26,990000
I assure you that there was never any danger for the ethnic peace in Bulgaria during this period.

418
0:44:32,000000 --> 0:44:32,990000
If there was such a danger,

419
0:44:35,000000 --> 0:44:35,990000
because the bloodshed in Yugoslavia was in Sochi,

420
0:44:38,000000 --> 0:44:38,990000
if there had to be such a danger,

421
0:44:40,000000 --> 0:44:40,990000
because he had to enter either in 1984-1985, when the development process started, or when it ended in 1989.

422
0:44:49,000000 --> 0:44:49,990000
I think that the Bulgarians and the Bulgarian Turks are still tolerant enough to avoid any danger from a curbside solution of the problem.

423
0:44:58,000000 --> 0:44:58,990000
But for me, and I continue to confirm it, the creation of the the DPS is harmful for Bulgarian politics,

424
0:45:05,000000 --> 0:45:05,990000
because it capsulates a community that should be integrated into the Bulgarian society.

425
0:45:13,000000 --> 0:45:13,990000
This is the Bulgarian Turks, the Bulgarian Muslims, because this is the DPS's electorate.

426
0:45:19,000000 --> 0:45:19,990000
There are different interests, different socialities, different beliefs.

427
0:45:23,000000 --> 0:45:23,990000
They should find their place in the Bulgarian parties,

428
0:45:26,000000 --> 0:45:26,990000
in the other Bulgarian parties, because the DPC is a Bulgarian party,

429
0:45:29,000000 --> 0:45:29,990000
and not to be represented by a community that somehow gives them the opportunity for alternatives.

430
0:45:38,000000 --> 0:45:38,990000
They are doomed to follow the DPC's policy, because they are afraid of what you said,

431
0:45:43,000000 --> 0:45:43,990000
that if they do not support the DPC, they will be violated again.

432
0:45:47,000000 --> 0:45:47,990000
While you, as citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria, like all other citizens, should seek the protection of ideas according to your own concerns.

433
0:45:57,000000 --> 0:45:57,990000
So in the legislative process there is this bad evidence that will create conditions for the party of the Bulgarian Turks will be created.

434
0:46:06,000000 --> 0:46:06,990000
I know that in Europe there is such a tendency, such a practice of creating ethnic parties,

435
0:46:12,000000 --> 0:46:12,990000
but I do not think this is a positive practice and we see it in what is happening in Western European countries.

436
0:46:20,000000 --> 0:46:20,990000
Citizens should act in the political as citizens, not as ethnic groups, not as members of one or another ethnic group.

437
0:46:31,500000 --> 0:46:37,700000
You know that in Bulgarian politics there are Jews in various organizations, there are Armenians in various organizations,

438
0:46:37,700000 --> 0:46:49
and this has not hurt their civil rights, on the contrary, in this way they express them. And that's why I think that the creation of the DPC was dangerous for Bulgarian democracy,

439
0:46:49,000000 --> 0:46:49,990000
but this is already a fact, it cannot be overcome, it cannot be avoided,

440
0:46:57,000000 --> 0:46:57,990000
because this is already a fact and this is one of the most negative consequences of the educational process.

441
0:47:04,000000 --> 0:47:04,990000
and this is one of the most negative consequences of the reproductive process. Thank you very much, Professor Baevac, for your invitation to the interview.

442
0:47:10,000000 --> 0:47:10,990000
I hope that the question has become clear for the reproductive process

443
0:47:17,000000 --> 0:47:17,990000
and I hope that in the future we will have such good topics for conversation. The topic is not very pleasant, because it is a very traumatic process,

444
0:47:30,000000 --> 0:47:30,990000
but you should teach us something about tolerance.

445
0:47:38,000000 --> 0:47:38,990000
Thank you once again, I wish you a good and peaceful evening.

446
0:47:43,000000 --> 0:47:43,990000
Thank you too, all the best to you.
