1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
The

2
0:00:01,320000 --> 0:00:02
first

3
0:00:02,000000 --> 0:00:02,990000
time

4
0:00:03,000000 --> 0:00:03,990000
I saw

5
0:00:04,000000 --> 0:00:04,990000
a

6
0:00:05,000000 --> 0:00:05,990000
dragon

7
0:00:06,000000 --> 0:00:06,990000
in

8
0:00:07,000000 --> 0:00:07,990000
the

9
0:00:08,000000 --> 0:00:08,990000
forest

10
0:00:09,000000 --> 0:00:09,990000
.

11
0:00:10,000000 --> 0:00:10,990000
I

12
0:00:11,000000 --> 0:00:11,990000
was

13
0:00:12,000000 --> 0:00:12,990000
surprised

14
0:00:13,000000 --> 0:00:13,990000
by

15
0:00:14,000000 --> 0:00:14,990000
the

16
0:00:15,000000 --> 0:00:15,990000
sound

17
0:00:16,000000 --> 0:00:16,990000
of

18
0:00:17,000000 --> 0:00:17,990000
the

19
0:00:18,000000 --> 0:00:18,990000
dragon

20
0:00:19,000000 --> 0:00:19,990000
.

21
0:00:20,000000 --> 0:00:20,990000
I

22
0:00:21,000000 --> 0:00:21,990000
was

23
0:00:22,000000 --> 0:00:22,990000
surprised

24
0:00:23,000000 --> 0:00:23,990000
by

25
0:00:24,000000 --> 0:00:24,990000
the sound of the DPS for Burgas lives 30 km from the city, in the village of Ranak.

26
0:00:42,000000 --> 0:00:42,990000
It is said that he collected metals. He lives in a village called Sabri Mehmetali, which is a kilometer from the town of Rannak.

27
0:00:47,000000 --> 0:00:47,990000
During the revival process his life changed completely.

28
0:00:53,000000 --> 0:00:53,990000
He is one of those 850,000 people who receive new names.

29
0:00:59,000000 --> 0:00:59,990000
Sabri stays in the archives of Mevere as Sevdalina Lipiev.

30
0:01:04,000000 --> 0:01:04,990000
He teaches his new name on a small hill to the village of Prilepov.

31
0:01:09,000000 --> 0:01:09,990000
First, the police came and said,

32
0:01:13,000000 --> 0:01:13,990000
I came to change my name.

33
0:01:15,000000 --> 0:01:15,990000
What did you do? I reacted harshly.

34
0:01:18,000000 --> 0:01:18,990000
Then they came again, reacted again,

35
0:01:22,000000 --> 0:01:22,990000
and ran away for about 17 minutes in the forest, to be honest.

36
0:01:26,000000 --> 0:01:26,990000
And I took some food and went to the village.

37
0:01:32,000000 --> 0:01:32,990000
The isolation of the village was far away.

38
0:01:36,000000 --> 0:01:36,990000
In the end they pressed, they drove into the meadow and pressed.

39
0:01:41,000000 --> 0:01:41,990000
And I said, in the end, serve whoever you want.

40
0:01:48,000000 --> 0:01:48,990000
Sabri Mehmetali and his brother Elin Madjarov are part of the prisoners of terror in the period of the revocation process.

41
0:01:55,000000 --> 0:01:55,990000
Of all the detainees, four receive death sentences.

42
0:01:59,000000 --> 0:01:59,990000
Many more are left in prison for the support of terrorist groups. These are 6 years of fear, in which in Bulgaria there are 617 terrorist acts committed by the Bulgarian Mohamedani.

43
0:02:13,760000 --> 0:02:19,040000
In the unpublished archives, for each of them, one victim is recorded.

44
0:02:19,040000 --> 0:02:25
6 years, in which there are also reports of acts of repression of the state against the Turkish population.

45
0:02:25,000000 --> 0:02:25,990000
Six years in which in the statistics of Mevarev are over 100 injured during the cases of terrorism.

46
0:02:37,000000 --> 0:02:37,990000
Dear friends, today in this solemn hour you will get a passport of a citizen of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

47
0:02:49,000000 --> 0:02:49,990000
Our people, a few months ago, lived in exciting moments,

48
0:02:54,000000 --> 0:02:54,990000
with which Mother Bulgaria took all her treasures and united her efforts.

49
0:03:01,000000 --> 0:03:01,990000
We wish all of you with pride to bear your Bulgarian name.

50
0:03:08,000000 --> 0:03:08,990000
In the early 80s, many films like this were shot for propaganda.

51
0:03:13,000000 --> 0:03:13,990000
All of them were projected as movie reviews in all movie salons.

52
0:03:17,000000 --> 0:03:17,990000
Sabrina watched them.

53
0:03:23,000000 --> 0:03:23,990000
Can you imagine what it was like? I was you, the terrorists are already in Turkey.

54
0:03:29,000000 --> 0:03:29,990000
How can you go out there? You won't believe in yourself. This process was determined for the first time as a renaissance 15 years later, on 18th January 1985, at the meeting of the Central Committee of the BKP.

55
0:03:51,000000 --> 0:03:51,990000
I give the floor to the Vice-President of the Council of the State.

56
0:03:54,000000 --> 0:03:54,990000
What is the problem? We need a watch, a watch at all costs, to see each other. Without a watch, we can no longer develop and exist.

57
0:04:12,000000 --> 0:04:12,990000
For Sabri and his brother Elin Madjarov it is impossible to give up their Turkish roots and suddenly become Bulgarian.

58
0:04:23,000000 --> 0:04:23,990000
As a sign of protest, the two brothers began to write anonymous letters and leaflets.

59
0:04:28,000000 --> 0:04:28,990000
First to the State Council of the Republic of Bulgaria, and then to Todor Zhivkov.

60
0:04:35,000000 --> 0:04:35,990000
Nearly 360,000 people do not wait for the end of this process and left the country with the so-called Great excursion.

61
0:04:47,000000 --> 0:04:47,990000
They left their homes and moved to Turkey before closing the border in September 1989.

62
0:05:04,000000 --> 0:05:04,990000
Sabri Mehmetali stayed with his brother.

63
0:05:07,000000 --> 0:05:07,990000
They became part of his group of comrades, who started to make a declaration, to spread the leaflets.

64
0:05:36,000000 --> 0:05:36,990000
I agreed and wrote 9 years in prison.

65
0:06:06,000000 --> 0:06:06,990000
the process of revival as a Bulgarian reaction against Turkey's ambitions to expand into continental Europe and exit the Asian world.

66
0:06:15,000000 --> 0:06:15,990000
Todor Zhivkov constantly points out the case of Cyprus,

67
0:06:19,000000 --> 0:06:19,990000
the occupation of Northern Cyprus and the establishment of the Northern Cypriot Republic of Turkey.

68
0:06:27,000000 --> 0:06:27,990000
There is also an experience for autonomy in Eastern Erdogan and in Northern Bulgaria.

69
0:06:34,000000 --> 0:06:34,990000
There are separatist organizations even in the 1970s.

70
0:06:40,000000 --> 0:06:40,990000
In his research, historians describe another project under the name called the Turkish Civilization in the World.

71
0:06:47,000000 --> 0:06:47,990000
This project has been recognized by Bulgaria as one of the many Turkish states,

72
0:06:52,000000 --> 0:06:52,990000
also by Hanko Brat and Asen.

73
0:06:58,000000 --> 0:06:58,990000
Foreign special services participated and had an influence on the situation they were forming. Because the manifestations of the so-called, I stress, so-called Turkish terrorism

74
0:07:11,000000 --> 0:07:11,990000
since that time in Bulgaria,

75
0:07:16,000000 --> 0:07:16,990000
in all cases, the least were approved and viewed as manifestations of some national war.

76
0:07:25,000000 --> 0:07:25,990000
and seen as a manifestation of some national struggle. The most influential in the situation in Bulgaria at that time

77
0:07:29,000000 --> 0:07:29,990000
are the Turkish intelligence services, known as MIT.

78
0:07:33,000000 --> 0:07:33,990000
They collect information about our military condition and the mood of the Polish population.

79
0:07:41,000000 --> 0:07:41,990000
There are also developments that in order to stop this influence, the state security itself came up with the revolutionary process.

80
0:07:49,000000 --> 0:07:49,990000
They were the executors, but those who commissioned the process were completely different people.

81
0:07:56,000000 --> 0:07:56,990000
It is known who they were, but unfortunately there is no written evidence of how the decision was made.

82
0:08:04,000000 --> 0:08:04,990000
Of course, it is known who they were. This is the leadership of the state. There is no written evidence of how the decision was made.

83
0:08:05,000000 --> 0:08:05,990000
Of course, you know who this is. The leadership of the state.

84
0:08:09,000000 --> 0:08:09,990000
The then Politburo.

85
0:08:11,000000 --> 0:08:11,990000
We are invited to take part in the presidential election and the deputy presidents of the state.

86
0:08:15,000000 --> 0:08:15,990000
At the end of the 1980s, Sabri Mehmet Ali was sentenced to 6 years in prison

87
0:08:20,000000 --> 0:08:20,990000
for assisting a criminal group in committing terrorist acts.

88
0:08:24,320000 --> 0:08:26,320000
to help a criminal group in carrying out terrorist acts.

89
0:08:33,320000 --> 0:08:39,320000
He was released from prison and immediately after 10 November 1989 he was amnestied. Then the resurgent trial was recognized as a mistake and the Turkish names were returned.

90
0:08:41,320000 --> 0:08:48
The same case was filed against his brother Erin Madjarov was convicted for acts of sabotage and terrorism

91
0:08:48,000000 --> 0:08:48,990000
because of the negative attitude towards the events of the Bulgarian nation.

92
0:08:55,000000 --> 0:08:55,990000
His sentence is death.

93
0:08:59,000000 --> 0:08:59,990000
We did not make a deal. After we saw the case, the Sofia Central Prison was left to us.

94
0:09:12,000000 --> 0:09:12,990000
They took us to the Al-Qa'at's rooms, where we were interrogated.

95
0:09:18,000000 --> 0:09:18,990000
They took me there, then they took him. They brought him to the hospital. In 10-15 minutes, we had the last meeting.

96
0:09:25,500000 --> 0:09:29
August 2, 1988.

97
0:09:29,000000 --> 0:09:29,990000
This was the last day of my brother's death.

98
0:09:37,500000 --> 0:09:42,500000
During the resurgent process, the decision was made to name the dead Turks.

99
0:09:42,500000 --> 0:09:46
To this day, the specialists have not found evidence

100
0:09:46,000000 --> 0:09:46,990000
who and when made this decision.

101
0:09:50,000000 --> 0:09:50,990000
There is no explanation where the new names of the dead are inscribed.

102
0:09:54,000000 --> 0:09:54,990000
Neither who and why they were shot from the graves

103
0:09:57,000000 --> 0:09:57,990000
their birth names.
