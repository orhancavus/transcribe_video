The American Pronunciation Guide Presents ''How to Pronounce

2
0:00:01,220000 --> 0:00:47
The American Pronunciation Guide'' I'm sorry. The story of the man who was involved in the revival process.

3
0:00:55,000000 --> 0:00:55,990000
Today I am meeting with a man who was involved in the revival process.

4
0:01:00,000000 --> 0:01:00,990000
He was a coward and a policeman.

5
0:01:02,000000 --> 0:01:02,990000
You probably have heard or heard historical testimonies of victims of the revival process.

6
0:01:07,000000 --> 0:01:07,990000
Today you will hear those who did it.

7
0:01:09,000000 --> 0:01:09,990000
They did it with their hands, with hammers, sticks and pistols.

8
0:01:13,000000 --> 0:01:13,990000
The system was falling apart.

9
0:01:15,000000 --> 0:01:15,990000
Some people wanted to live with their names freely chosen.

10
0:01:17,000000 --> 0:01:17,990000
Turkish names.

11
0:01:19,000000 --> 0:01:19,990000
Some idiot from the communist regime decided that he should change their names.

12
0:01:24,000000 --> 0:01:24,990000
So everything started.

13
0:01:26,000000 --> 0:01:26,990000
And Venci, our storyteller, was there, under the rain of stones and the sea of gills,

14
0:01:31,000000 --> 0:01:31,990000
in the excitement of the revival process.

15
0:01:35,000000 --> 0:01:35,990000
What's your name?

16
0:01:37,000000 --> 0:01:37,990000
I'm Serden Safvat Arnazov Angelov. I'm a Bulgarian citizen.

17
0:01:40,000000 --> 0:01:40,990000
How old are you?

18
0:01:41,000000 --> 0:01:41,990000
I'm 45 years old.

19
0:01:43,000000 --> 0:01:43,990000
I understand that when you were young you were a militia officer.

20
0:01:46,000000 --> 0:01:46,990000
Yes, we graduated from the Lithuanian school in 1988 with a degree in success and we were appointed to the Kat-Russe sector as a kid in the auto-control department.

21
0:01:56,000000 --> 0:01:56,990000
What is this? Katadzhi?

22
0:01:57,000000 --> 0:01:57,990000
Katadzhi, yes, but I say it in the official language.

23
0:01:59,000000 --> 0:01:59,990000
Yes, but to make it clear, Katadzhi.

24
0:02:01,000000 --> 0:02:01,990000
Katadzhi, exactly.

25
0:02:02,000000 --> 0:02:02,990000
Katadzhi. At what age were you when graduated from Katadzija? At 20 years old.

26
0:02:06,000000 --> 0:02:06,990000
At 20 years old?

27
0:02:08,000000 --> 0:02:08,990000
Yes.

28
0:02:10,000000 --> 0:02:10,990000
You graduated from this school very early.

29
0:02:12,000000 --> 0:02:12,990000
I was in the 10th grade.

30
0:02:14,000000 --> 0:02:14,990000
I was 16 when I graduated and at 19 and a half

31
0:02:16,000000 --> 0:02:16,990000
I graduated from the medical school.

32
0:02:18,000000 --> 0:02:18,990000
You became a socialist medic.

33
0:02:20,000000 --> 0:02:20,990000
You can say that.

34
0:02:22,000000 --> 0:02:22,990000
I wanted to become a medic since I was a kid.

35
0:02:24,000000 --> 0:02:24,990000
I wanted to help people policeman. To help people.

36
0:02:25,000000 --> 0:02:25,990000
This is your dream?

37
0:02:26,000000 --> 0:02:26,990000
Exactly. A childhood dream.

38
0:02:27,000000 --> 0:02:27,990000
To become a policeman?

39
0:02:28,000000 --> 0:02:28,990000
Exactly.

40
0:02:29,000000 --> 0:02:29,990000
But you went to Russia and they distributed you a cottage. Did you want that?

41
0:02:31,000000 --> 0:02:31,990000
In Russia, since we were 13 people and I was a volunteer in 1988, the third, I mean, I succeeded,

42
0:02:37,000000 --> 0:02:37,990000
they offered me the best place, which was then in the structure of Medvere,

43
0:02:41,000000 --> 0:02:41,990000
Sector Cut, in the city of Rosy. One bar and I went there.

44
0:02:44,000000 --> 0:02:44,990000
With a cottage? Exactly. I was in the structure of the sector cut, one block and I got there. How did you get into the events, tell me in detail how you got into the events around the process?

45
0:02:53,000000 --> 0:02:53,990000
The process for me was something like an appeal, a process.

46
0:02:59,000000 --> 0:02:59,990000
So I didn't know in the long run what he was thinking. And this happened in May.

47
0:03:06,000000 --> 0:03:06,990000
I found the date on the Internet.

48
0:03:09,000000 --> 0:03:09,990000
May 19th, a Sunday afternoon.

49
0:03:12,000000 --> 0:03:12,990000
In which year?

50
0:03:15,000000 --> 0:03:15,990000
In 1982.

51
0:03:18,000000 --> 0:03:18,990000
They started to leave on June 1st.

52
0:03:21,000000 --> 0:03:21,990000
I think that at the end of June the war started.

53
0:03:24,000000 --> 0:03:24,990000
Then Todor Zhukov came out to speak and they left. Exactly.

54
0:03:25,000000 --> 0:03:25,990000
And before that you participated in the events?

55
0:03:27,000000 --> 0:03:27,990000
So we participated in the culmination of these events. They started a long time before that.

56
0:03:31,000000 --> 0:03:31,990000
While I was in medical school, we were hearing about miracles, what happened in Kursk.

57
0:03:36,000000 --> 0:03:36,990000
What did you hear?

58
0:03:37,000000 --> 0:03:37,990000
We heard, for example, that our students, that is, the older ones, were there for 4-5 months after they had enough time for training.

59
0:03:46,000000 --> 0:03:46,990000
They were assigned there, they were doing some postings, some violent actions.

60
0:03:50,000000 --> 0:03:50,990000
They said, I have only heard about this thing.

61
0:03:53,000000 --> 0:03:53,990000
But I know it was scary in the district. It was scary.

62
0:03:56,000000 --> 0:03:56,990000
When I was in the military school, I heard about terrible things.

63
0:03:59,000000 --> 0:03:59,990000
What?

64
0:04:00,000000 --> 0:04:00,990000
For example, with machine guns, with BTR tanks, with the tanks that entered the village, violence, killing, stabbing, breaking heads, people who are illiterate,

65
0:04:10,000000 --> 0:04:10,990000
no one knew where they were, we heard about the

66
0:04:14,120000 --> 0:04:16,120000
Pazdrajevski district, we heard that there were such prisoners, they were called then the police.

67
0:04:16,120000 --> 0:04:21,120000
We only heard, but nothing categorically, no one told us, because we were on the border of Pazdrajevski.

68
0:04:21,120000 --> 0:04:23,120000
Did you have political officers then?

69
0:04:23,120000 --> 0:04:30
Yes, we had a police officer in PazdraÅ¾ek. The political officer was the one who followed the decisions of the Politburo, the Central Committee, the BKP etc.

70
0:04:30,000000 --> 0:04:30,990000
But what happened to us, I can't speak specifically, it happened that we were fired.

71
0:04:35,000000 --> 0:04:35,990000
How?

72
0:04:36,000000 --> 0:04:36,990000
We were fired because we were children who grew up in the construction industry.

73
0:04:39,000000 --> 0:04:39,990000
In 1985 they started talking about the truth about socialism, what it is, how it is.

74
0:04:43,000000 --> 0:04:43,990000
We were simply fired.

75
0:04:44,000000 --> 0:04:44,990000
We were the ones who, when our political officer stood in front of the company, we told him again. In the 90s they started to talk about socialism, what it is, what it is, what it is. They just stole us.

76
0:04:46,000000 --> 0:04:46,990000
We were the ones who, when our political officer was speaking in front of the company, we said it again,

77
0:04:50,000000 --> 0:04:50,990000
and no one could understand where the things came from.

78
0:04:54,000000 --> 0:04:54,990000
We were the only one who did it.

79
0:04:56,000000 --> 0:04:56,990000
The system started to fall apart.

80
0:04:58,000000 --> 0:04:58,990000
Exactly. Our eyes were open to the truth.

81
0:05:01,000000 --> 0:05:01,990000
We had understood that socialism was not what we had talked about and what we had been taught.

82
0:05:06,000000 --> 0:05:06,990000
We knew about the Gaghanian deception called socialism.

83
0:05:09,000000 --> 0:05:09,990000
But we could not do anything because we had learned it inside.

84
0:05:12,000000 --> 0:05:12,990000
Outside, no one in any way, we were absolutely apolitical, no one cared about politics, no one thought about politics.

85
0:05:18,000000 --> 0:05:18,990000
We wanted to become revolutionaries, to serve society and the people.

86
0:05:21,000000 --> 0:05:21,990000
I am sure that there were such many swords of all of us who were there.

87
0:05:26,000000 --> 0:05:26,990000
But gradually, over the years, things started to break through my blood.

88
0:05:32,000000 --> 0:05:32,990000
So, I understand that you have a dream to become a policeman and at 20 you are already a policeman.

89
0:05:36,000000 --> 0:05:36,990000
Exactly.

90
0:05:37,000000 --> 0:05:37,990000
But you have the door behind your feet, they send you directly to these events.

91
0:05:40,000000 --> 0:05:40,990000
So, it's not direct, I will tell you, it year passed, a little bit less than a year.

92
0:05:46,000000 --> 0:05:46,990000
I arrived on 1st August 1988, I was on the way to the sector with the order.

93
0:05:52,000000 --> 0:05:52,990000
These events took place in May 1982. How did it all happen?

94
0:05:57,000000 --> 0:05:57,990000
In Russia there is a rally that is held every year under the patronage of CBA.

95
0:06:01,000000 --> 0:06:01,990000
This is a car championship on the road junction of Bogov. I was there only once. This was my first year, when I was already a member of the team.

96
0:06:09,000000 --> 0:06:09,990000
This week our shift was on work.

97
0:06:12,000000 --> 0:06:12,990000
On Saturday the training is held, and on Sunday the season itself.

98
0:06:15,000000 --> 0:06:15,990000
On one of the tracks of the circles, which is a break, we get an alarm. We received a call from the radio station.

99
0:06:25,000000 --> 0:06:25,990000
Everyone was called to the court.

100
0:06:28,000000 --> 0:06:28,990000
They were gathered there.

101
0:06:30,000000 --> 0:06:30,990000
In front of us was the Pope, Pope Ennev, who was the head of the police in the whole district of Mevere.

102
0:06:37,000000 --> 0:06:37,990000
Below him was Alexander Stefanov, who was the deputy head of the state for the district management of Mevere

103
0:06:46,000000 --> 0:06:46,990000
and Jordan Krstev, who was a higher-ups

104
0:06:49,000000 --> 0:06:49,990000
or a Major, I can't remember exactly,

105
0:06:52,000000 --> 0:06:52,990000
who is Deputy Chief of National Police.

106
0:06:55,000000 --> 0:06:55,990000
He came to us and said,

107
0:06:58,000000 --> 0:06:58,990000
Sir, I'm sorry, I'm a friend,

108
0:07:01,000000 --> 0:07:01,990000
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry,

109
0:07:04,000000 --> 0:07:04,990000
we need to help our colleagues from the outskirts. There were riots, violations of public order.

110
0:07:10,000000 --> 0:07:10,990000
I beg you, for an hour, after an hour, I met again in the guardhouse.

111
0:07:15,000000 --> 0:07:15,990000
Go home, full-fledged weapons.

112
0:07:18,000000 --> 0:07:18,990000
What does full-fledged weapon, a full-fledged gun, a full-fledged ammunition, a police stick, a piece of cloth.

113
0:07:29,000000 --> 0:07:29,990000
We had to take the cards, the bags, in which we write the names of the people and the sticks.

114
0:07:35,000000 --> 0:07:35,990000
And the uniform.

115
0:07:36,000000 --> 0:07:36,990000
And the uniform, the full-fledged uniform, so that the headgear and the official uniform should be worn.

116
0:07:41,000000 --> 0:07:41,990000
Exactly. The uniform is not official.

117
0:07:45,000000 --> 0:07:45,990000
But with a cap.

118
0:07:47,000000 --> 0:07:47,990000
In one of the meetings we were there.

119
0:07:49,000000 --> 0:07:49,990000
We were all there.

120
0:07:51,000000 --> 0:07:51,990000
Then we were given the following instructions.

121
0:07:53,000000 --> 0:07:53,990000
You go under the leadership of Mr.

122
0:07:55,000000 --> 0:07:55,990000
Mr. Dogar Jordan Krstev,

123
0:07:57,000000 --> 0:07:57,990000
who is the deputy chief of the police,

124
0:07:59,000000 --> 0:07:59,990000
you go and take action

125
0:08:01,000000 --> 0:08:01,990000
of our colleagues from Razvat,

126
0:08:03,000000 --> 0:08:03,990000
because there are riots, there is experience of of experience in the government, which is a state violation.

127
0:08:07,000000 --> 0:08:07,990000
Are you paying?

128
0:08:09,000000 --> 0:08:09,990000
At first, yes, plus I pay.

129
0:08:13,000000 --> 0:08:13,990000
Because this is a very big job to say a state violation.

130
0:08:16,000000 --> 0:08:16,990000
Well, you pay, but what can you do? I am with a 10-digit contract, borrowed from Pazarchevka.

131
0:08:20,000000 --> 0:08:20,990000
I have no right to... no, no, I have no right to borrow the language at all.

132
0:08:22,000000 --> 0:08:22,990000
Do you have to pay? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, We had about 20 cars, and we were 80-100 people in front of us.

133
0:08:45,400000 --> 0:08:48,400000
A group of about 9 Russians.

134
0:08:48,400000 --> 0:08:50,400000
And you didn't know where to go?

135
0:08:50,400000 --> 0:08:52,400000
We knew we were going down.

136
0:08:52,400000 --> 0:08:56,400000
But we didn't know what was ahead of us.

137
0:08:56,400000 --> 0:08:58,400000
Nobody told us anything.

138
0:08:58,400000 --> 0:09:04,400000
We went in the direction of the road that leads to Sofia and Varna.

139
0:09:04,400000 --> 0:09:06
We drove...

140
0:09:06,000000 --> 0:09:06,990000
With which cars or trucks?

141
0:09:08,000000 --> 0:09:08,990000
Militia cars. Only militia cars.

142
0:09:10,000000 --> 0:09:10,990000
With lamps?

143
0:09:12,000000 --> 0:09:12,990000
Yes. We drove down through the red water.

144
0:09:14,000000 --> 0:09:14,990000
Who knows where the road is.

145
0:09:16,000000 --> 0:09:16,990000
About 15 km from the bottom we were met by a barricade,

146
0:09:20,000000 --> 0:09:20,990000
about 3 or 4 barricades,

147
0:09:22,000000 --> 0:09:22,990000
on the road, stones,

148
0:09:24,000000 --> 0:09:24,990000
laid bare stone, made in the form of pyramids.

149
0:09:28,000000 --> 0:09:28,990000
This was to be fun. So they started the event much earlier than we started.

150
0:09:34,000000 --> 0:09:34,990000
That's how we think, because these barricades were the goal at the moment, some barricades to slowly increase the support. to be able to pass the bus stops as slowly as possible.

151
0:09:45,000000 --> 0:09:45,990000
What did you do?

152
0:09:46,000000 --> 0:09:46,990000
The Bulgarian police made a special selection of us.

153
0:09:50,000000 --> 0:09:50,990000
The police?

154
0:09:51,000000 --> 0:09:51,990000
Yes, the police who changed the names.

155
0:09:54,000000 --> 0:09:54,990000
What was interesting was that when we stopped for the car,

156
0:09:56,000000 --> 0:09:56,990000
we met a stop and there was a car with two or three men.

157
0:10:01,000000 --> 0:10:01,990000
Naturally, as a guard, we asked who was making these barricades.

158
0:10:04,000000 --> 0:10:04,990000
We don't know who and how.

159
0:10:06,000000 --> 0:10:06,990000
I said, you are taking away the stones, what are you doing?

160
0:10:10,000000 --> 0:10:10,990000
So he didn't want to take away the stones?

161
0:10:12,000000 --> 0:10:12,990000
No, he didn't want to take away the stones, they were completely erased.

162
0:10:14,000000 --> 0:10:14,990000
Erased?

163
0:10:15,000000 --> 0:10:15,990000
Yes, they were erased from the fight.

164
0:10:16,000000 --> 0:10:16,990000
From you?

165
0:10:17,000000 --> 0:10:17,990000
From some of us.

166
0:10:18,000000 --> 0:10:18,990000
From some of us?

167
0:10:19,000000 --> 0:10:19,990000
I have participated, I don't know who, but...

168
0:10:20,000000 --> 0:10:20,990000
You didn't participate in the fight?

169
0:10:21,000000 --> 0:10:21,990000
No.

170
0:10:22,000000 --> 0:10:22,990000
How? What did they destroy?

171
0:10:23,000000 --> 0:10:23,990000
What do you think?

172
0:10:24,000000 --> 0:10:24,990000
Sparks, middlemen, boots, clothes, car and directly in the police station.

173
0:10:28,000000 --> 0:10:28,990000
Because he refused to raise a stone.

174
0:10:30,000000 --> 0:10:30,990000
Exactly. For the sake of the public order.

175
0:10:32,000000 --> 0:10:32,990000
For the preservation of the military equipment.

176
0:10:34,000000 --> 0:10:34,990000
There are many terms, many opportunities that can teach a person to repress him.

177
0:10:39,000000 --> 0:10:39,990000
They can choose you for everything.

178
0:10:41,000000 --> 0:10:41,990000
Absolutely.

179
0:10:42,000000 --> 0:10:42,990000
Especially then.

180
0:10:43,000000 --> 0:10:43,990000
I even comment on it. So this is the first fight.

181
0:10:46,000000 --> 0:10:46,990000
This is the first fight that made me very sad.

182
0:10:48,000000 --> 0:10:48,990000
Why?

183
0:10:49,000000 --> 0:10:49,990000
Because the man was not guilty. He stood aside.

184
0:10:52,000000 --> 0:10:52,990000
What is the fault that someone else has set the stones on the street so that they do not get caught in some way?

185
0:10:59,000000 --> 0:10:59,990000
He is not guilty. Even more so, he cannot take them away.

186
0:11:01,000000 --> 0:11:01,990000
Imagine, he threw two tons of stones and he got lost. How can anyone take them away? They are put there with 23 people, they are't take them off. Imagine two tons of stones and you are on the road.

187
0:11:05,000000 --> 0:11:05,990000
How can anyone take them off?

188
0:11:07,000000 --> 0:11:07,990000
They are put there with 23 people, with horses.

189
0:11:10,000000 --> 0:11:10,990000
But whatever it is, since then the adrenaline has not risen.

190
0:11:13,000000 --> 0:11:13,990000
Down, up, aha, they say, there are a lot of people here,

191
0:11:16,000000 --> 0:11:16,990000
maybe there will be something that we did not expect.

192
0:11:19,000000 --> 0:11:19,990000
It's a double story.

193
0:11:21,000000 --> 0:11:21,990000
Yes, because we are on the road, on the main road,

194
0:11:23,000000 --> 0:11:23,990000
but still the main task is to put four or. When they change buses, cars,

195
0:11:26,000000 --> 0:11:26,990000
to put 4-5 camels and so on,

196
0:11:29,000000 --> 0:11:29,990000
it's just a labyrinth, you can go under the labyrinth.

197
0:11:32,000000 --> 0:11:32,990000
You can't go directly.

198
0:11:33,000000 --> 0:11:33,990000
So you have a strategy.

199
0:11:34,000000 --> 0:11:34,990000
Yes, a complete strategy.

200
0:11:35,000000 --> 0:11:35,990000
Everything was normal.

201
0:11:36,000000 --> 0:11:36,990000
This was the first time I was on a bus.

202
0:11:38,000000 --> 0:11:38,990000
I said to my colleagues,

203
0:11:39,000000 --> 0:11:39,990000
I don't need to get used to this person.

204
0:11:41,000000 --> 0:11:41,990000
I said to my colleagues,

205
0:11:42,000000 --> 0:11:42,990000
why are you getting used to this half-dead person?

206
0:11:43,000000 --> 0:11:43,990000
This is a conversation between me and my colleagues.

207
0:11:46,000000 --> 0:11:46,990000
But it is the same now. We are perfect.

208
0:11:49,000000 --> 0:11:49,990000
Yes, but this is being done on purpose at the moment.

209
0:11:52,000000 --> 0:11:52,990000
Yes, they are raising their voices and now they are saying that they are absurd.

210
0:11:55,000000 --> 0:11:55,990000
Now you will see what will happen to me.

211
0:11:58,000000 --> 0:11:58,990000
What were the absurdities?

212
0:12:01,000000 --> 0:12:01,990000
The habits of the mother.

213
0:12:04,000000 --> 0:12:04,990000
Yes, the mother is Turkish, the my mother is in Turkey, we will kill them, we will do this and that.

214
0:12:07,000000 --> 0:12:07,990000
You know how it is.

215
0:12:08,000000 --> 0:12:08,990000
I don't know how it is, because they are not from Turkey.

216
0:12:11,000000 --> 0:12:11,990000
So, to raise your adrenaline, you start to f**k your mother in Turkey,

217
0:12:16,000000 --> 0:12:16,990000
where to raise now, the rest of the family, you know how it is.

218
0:12:19,000000 --> 0:12:19,990000
They are 100% big strategists, they are sure.

219
0:12:23,000000 --> 0:12:23,990000
They didn't build it so well, they didn't make it so good, that there is just nowhere.

220
0:12:26,000000 --> 0:12:26,990000
I am not saying this, I am thinking about this, by the way.

221
0:12:29,000000 --> 0:12:29,990000
There, too, the same propaganda of strategy is being poured into us.

222
0:12:32,000000 --> 0:12:32,990000
The medical school.

223
0:12:33,000000 --> 0:12:33,990000
Yes, the party, for the party, the people, the party-people, that's all they say.

224
0:12:38,000000 --> 0:12:38,990000
Party-people, but at some point you see that there is no party-people.

225
0:12:41,000000 --> 0:12:41,990000
There are local philadels, commercial philadels.

226
0:12:44,000000 --> 0:12:44,990000
Like now we have the local philadords, like the local feudal lords now.

227
0:12:45,000000 --> 0:12:45,990000
If they were capitalistic feudal lords, then there were local...

228
0:12:50,000000 --> 0:12:50,990000
Party secretaries.

229
0:12:51,000000 --> 0:12:51,990000
Ah, they were feudal lords. Exactly.

230
0:12:54,000000 --> 0:12:54,990000
Yes, but the Turks were encouraged to beat them.

231
0:12:56,000000 --> 0:12:56,990000
How? This is part of the game.

232
0:12:59,000000 --> 0:12:59,990000
The propaganda knows how to manipulate us.

233
0:13:02,000000 --> 0:13:02,990000
So, these Kuklovites, to be honest, they know how to

234
0:13:05,000000 --> 0:13:05,990000
manipulate, how to achieve the gigantic manipulation over the masses.

235
0:13:08,000000 --> 0:13:08,990000
How they inspired you.

236
0:13:09,000000 --> 0:13:09,990000
Exactly. They inspired us on an ethnic basis.

237
0:13:12,000000 --> 0:13:12,990000
They opposed us before the civil war.

238
0:13:15,000000 --> 0:13:15,990000
They opposed us with this.

239
0:13:17,000000 --> 0:13:17,990000
Before you meet them, you will know how to do it.

240
0:13:18,000000 --> 0:13:18,990000
Exactly. The mother is Turkish, the mother is Turkish, we will feed them, we will beat them, this is normal.

241
0:13:48,000000 --> 0:13:48,990000
We arrived long ago. The picture was... Before the city. We will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat them, we will eat crowd, and I said that he would not be wrong, because this is a group of people who are with a crowd. How many people were there?

242
0:13:50,000000 --> 0:13:50,990000
More than 250, 300, 400 people, because there were also children.

243
0:13:54,000000 --> 0:13:54,990000
Did you expect that they were Bulgarian Muhammedans?

244
0:13:56,000000 --> 0:13:56,990000
In no way. Except for the brothers, we say that You were a woman, you had a wife and children.

245
0:14:06,000000 --> 0:14:06,990000
Yes, I had a wife and children, old women, grandmothers, grandfathers.

246
0:14:09,000000 --> 0:14:09,990000
You had posters.

247
0:14:10,000000 --> 0:14:10,990000
Yes, two posters.

248
0:14:11,000000 --> 0:14:11,990000
Below BKP, you wanted the names.

249
0:14:12,000000 --> 0:14:12,990000
These are two?

250
0:14:13,000000 --> 0:14:13,990000
The two posters that stressed us a lot.

251
0:14:15,000000 --> 0:14:15,990000
This is the first time I see such posters.

252
0:14:17,000000 --> 0:14:17,990000
Below BKP, give us the names.

253
0:14:18,000000 --> 0:14:18,990000
You see, this is terrible.

254
0:14:19,000000 --> 0:14:19,990000
Yes, in the direction of communism.

255
0:14:21,000000 --> 0:14:21,990000
This is very terrible.

256
0:14:22,000000 --> 0:14:22,990000
That's why you know, you are in the The police department knew and the other members knew more.

257
0:14:27,000000 --> 0:14:27,990000
Until they broke through.

258
0:14:29,000000 --> 0:14:29,990000
The moment we got behind us, a helicopter was flying over us.

259
0:14:33,000000 --> 0:14:33,990000
Later we found out that it was Dimitr Stoyanov.

260
0:14:35,000000 --> 0:14:35,990000
In the helicopter.

261
0:14:37,000000 --> 0:14:37,990000
That's why we found out.

262
0:14:39,000000 --> 0:14:39,990000
And on the other side, there was the dark-soul general, Dimitr Stoyanov.

263
0:14:43,000000 --> 0:14:43,990000
He was the leader of great hero in Bulgaria.

264
0:14:45,000000 --> 0:14:45,990000
He saved everyone from it.

265
0:14:48,000000 --> 0:14:48,990000
We arrived, we saw the people from outside, our chief commander,

266
0:14:52,000000 --> 0:14:52,990000
then the megaphone came out and said,

267
0:14:56,000000 --> 0:14:56,990000
''Drogari, you are violating the public order.''

268
0:14:59,000000 --> 0:14:59,990000
And we slightly bowed to the crowd.

269
0:15:02,000000 --> 0:15:02,990000
Let's say this is a crowd. Whether it is a crowd, it is a crowd. We bowed slightly, I was close, like the youngest, the crowd. Let's say that this is the crowd. If it's a crowd, then it's the crowd.

270
0:15:06,000000 --> 0:15:06,990000
We were in the crowd, a little bit.

271
0:15:08,000000 --> 0:15:08,990000
I was close to being the youngest.

272
0:15:10,000000 --> 0:15:10,990000
I was training, I was training new karate,

273
0:15:12,000000 --> 0:15:12,990000
culturalism, I was very young,

274
0:15:14,000000 --> 0:15:14,990000
I was a five-year-old, I can say.

275
0:15:16,000000 --> 0:15:16,990000
How?

276
0:15:18,000000 --> 0:15:18,990000
Well, with a very serious self-esteem.

277
0:15:20,000000 --> 0:15:20,990000
For me, I could easily deal with one or two people.

278
0:15:22,000000 --> 0:15:22,990000
I trained for three years in Pasadzik.

279
0:15:24,000000 --> 0:15:24,990000
Culturalism, karate, good physical training, I was well-known and professional.

280
0:15:28,000000 --> 0:15:28,990000
And you got involved?

281
0:15:29,000000 --> 0:15:29,990000
We got involved a little bit.

282
0:15:31,000000 --> 0:15:31,990000
We wanted to explain that what you do is a violation of the social order,

283
0:15:34,000000 --> 0:15:34,990000
that it is against the constitution, that it is against the law.

284
0:15:36,000000 --> 0:15:36,990000
But they didn't listen to us at all.

285
0:15:38,000000 --> 0:15:38,990000
They said, oh, murderers, murderers, murderers.

286
0:15:40,000000 --> 0:15:40,990000
What did they say?

287
0:15:41,000000 --> 0:15:41,990000
No one was killed?

288
0:15:42,000000 --> 0:15:42,990000
No, no, no one was killed.

289
0:15:43,000000 --> 0:15:43,990000
They just said, murderers, No, we are not murderers. They just said murderers, put their names, different names.

290
0:15:46,000000 --> 0:15:46,990000
Did they say it in Turkish?

291
0:15:48,000000 --> 0:15:48,990000
No, in Bulgarian.

292
0:15:50,000000 --> 0:15:50,990000
When we left the hotel yesterday,

293
0:15:52,000000 --> 0:15:52,990000
we pulled back.

294
0:15:54,000000 --> 0:15:54,990000
I covered him with a blanket.

295
0:15:56,000000 --> 0:15:56,990000
And only when we pulled back,

296
0:15:58,000000 --> 0:15:58,990000
I saw the children

297
0:16:00,000000 --> 0:16:00,990000
between the people.

298
0:16:02,000000 --> 0:16:02,990000
And the children went back.

299
0:16:04,000000 --> 0:16:04,990000
The children went back? people, and the children went down.

300
0:16:08,000000 --> 0:16:08,990000
The children went back?

301
0:16:09,000000 --> 0:16:09,990000
Yes, they went back.

302
0:16:10,000000 --> 0:16:10,990000
They prepared something?

303
0:16:11,000000 --> 0:16:11,990000
Yes, they prepared something. The boss is here, the father is here, something to know.

304
0:16:16,000000 --> 0:16:16,990000
And he said, what, what, and only when he heard what, they flew to us like stones. I was in one of the first cars and there was a stop. The stop had these blocks, there were these broken blocks that were built.

305
0:16:28,000000 --> 0:16:28,990000
I don't know if you've seen them.

306
0:16:30,000000 --> 0:16:30,990000
You can't find them again because they break down.

307
0:16:32,000000 --> 0:16:32,990000
Yes, exactly.

308
0:16:33,000000 --> 0:16:33,990000
The stone that hit the block, because it was vacuumed from the inside, it became like a bomb.

309
0:16:37,000000 --> 0:16:37,990000
It was sprayed like a bomb.

310
0:16:38,000000 --> 0:16:38,990000
All the officers who were around me, everything was hidden.

311
0:16:41,000000 --> 0:16:41,990000
Any cadet that was driving, was coming under the car, under the car cover, in the car, there is no place to hide.

312
0:16:51,000000 --> 0:16:51,990000
Rain from the stones, I can tell you a very scary thing.

313
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
A very scary thing, there is no way to escape. There is no salvation.

314
0:16:57,000000 --> 0:16:57,990000
Did he hit you on the stone?

315
0:16:58,000000 --> 0:16:58,990000
He didn't hit me, but he hit many people.

316
0:17:00,000000 --> 0:17:00,990000
There were people with broken heads, broken hands, torn legs, here it was a very dusty place.

317
0:17:07,000000 --> 0:17:07,990000
The car was like a stone, like a white car, the whole area was shaking.

318
0:17:12,000000 --> 0:17:12,990000
On the hood of the car, there was a huge noise.

319
0:17:15,000000 --> 0:17:15,990000
Rain from the stones. The situation was very bad.

320
0:17:18,000000 --> 0:17:18,990000
There was no way to stop.

321
0:17:21,000000 --> 0:17:21,990000
They were not provoked, they just stopped immediately.

322
0:17:24,000000 --> 0:17:24,990000
What happened to them?

323
0:17:26,000000 --> 0:17:26,990000
I can't tell you. When we went there, there was a BTR with about 7 or 8 people.

324
0:17:31,000000 --> 0:17:31,990000
One BTR and one police officer who was the district inspector of the Makhlata.

325
0:17:37,000000 --> 0:17:37,990000
We saw a crowd of people from all sides. There was no one.

326
0:17:41,000000 --> 0:17:41,990000
Only you?

327
0:17:42,000000 --> 0:17:42,990000
Only us. And there were no cameras.

328
0:17:44,000000 --> 0:17:44,990000
If we had seen the cameras on the road,

329
0:17:46,000000 --> 0:17:46,990000
to say that they were thrown in front of us, you would have told us that something could have happened.

330
0:17:50,000000 --> 0:17:50,990000
There was absolutely no one.

331
0:17:52,000000 --> 0:17:52,990000
Then, when the events passed, it is possible to say that they deliberately sent us.

332
0:17:56,000000 --> 0:17:56,990000
Why?

333
0:17:57,000000 --> 0:17:57,990000
And when they sent the Red Army, before that there were hungry dogs,

334
0:18:00,000000 --> 0:18:00,990000
there were rebels, and we didn't know them.

335
0:18:02,000000 --> 0:18:02,990000
And then, because there was power,

336
0:18:04,000000 --> 0:18:04,990000
immediately it would be reflected in the international media,

337
0:18:07,000000 --> 0:18:07,990000
international, European,

338
0:18:09,000000 --> 0:18:09,990000
that the internal forces were thrown against peaceful protesters.

339
0:18:12,000000 --> 0:18:12,990000
They were like, peaceful protesters, they didn't do anything wrong.

340
0:18:15,000000 --> 0:18:15,990000
They were very aware of the main issue.

341
0:18:17,000000 --> 0:18:17,990000
They didn't send us to the knees.

342
0:18:19,000000 --> 0:18:19,990000
This is my opinion.

343
0:18:20,000000 --> 0:18:20,990000
How many people were there?

344
0:18:21,000000 --> 0:18:21,990000
Between 80 and 100.

345
0:18:23,000000 --> 0:18:23,990000
So, twice as few.

346
0:18:24,000000 --> 0:18:24,990000
Yes. And we have no shields, no helmets, we have nothing. How many people were there? Between 80 and 100. So, twice as few?

347
0:18:26,000000 --> 0:18:26,990000
Yes. And we didn't have any shields, no helmets, nothing.

348
0:18:30,000000 --> 0:18:30,990000
We had a military cap, a stick, a hundred sticks, a gun, a police stick.

349
0:18:34,000000 --> 0:18:34,990000
We had nothing.

350
0:18:36,000000 --> 0:18:36,990000
And your stick was for fighting?

351
0:18:38,000000 --> 0:18:38,990000
The police stick was for fighting, there was no doubt about it.

352
0:18:40,000000 --> 0:18:40,990000
They told us to use full combat weapons.

353
0:18:42,000000 --> 0:18:42,990000
We had no problem with that.

354
0:18:44,000000 --> 0:18:44,990000
We knew that we had to use full armed, but not to kill people.

355
0:18:48,000000 --> 0:18:48,990000
The respect was very high to the police.

356
0:18:52,000000 --> 0:18:52,990000
You knew how to fight without protecting civil human rights.

357
0:18:57,000000 --> 0:18:57,990000
I have seen such a war.

358
0:18:59,000000 --> 0:18:59,990000
This is a fact.

359
0:19:01,000000 --> 0:19:01,990000
Nobody gives you an explanation of human rights and civil rights.

360
0:19:05,000000 --> 0:19:05,990000
This commissary from Hemzaki, from 1976 or 2008, we didn't know about it.

361
0:19:09,000000 --> 0:19:09,990000
We didn't know about it.

362
0:19:10,000000 --> 0:19:10,990000
We didn't know it existed. What happened?

363
0:19:13,000000 --> 0:19:13,990000
When he was hiding in the underground, there were 7-8 officers, Jordan Krasapi was there.

364
0:19:19,000000 --> 0:19:19,990000
I won't mention him now, it's unethical to mention him in honest. I respect the police, but they were also present.

365
0:19:26,000000 --> 0:19:26,990000
They know about the course of the case.

366
0:19:29,000000 --> 0:19:29,990000
They were in command.

367
0:19:32,000000 --> 0:19:32,990000
Exactly. No one was in charge.

368
0:19:35,000000 --> 0:19:35,990000
All the officers we saw in the offices,

369
0:19:38,000000 --> 0:19:38,990000
who punished us, who beat us,

370
0:19:41,000000 --> 0:19:41,990000
they covered themselves like mice.

371
0:19:44,000000 --> 0:19:44,990000
One by one, they didn't come out in front of the staff and say,

372
0:19:45,000000 --> 0:19:45,990000
''Combat, hide, nothing.'' And they left us with the fate of the cause.

373
0:19:49,000000 --> 0:19:49,990000
From the staff or the attackers?

374
0:19:51,000000 --> 0:19:51,990000
No one.

375
0:19:52,000000 --> 0:19:52,990000
They were the

376
0:19:57,060000 --> 0:20:01
panic. I am the man who took off the incendiary and took out the pistol when I saw that we were already surrounded,

377
0:20:01,000000 --> 0:20:01,990000
because we see through the sky that my youth are passing through the field and throwing stones at us.

378
0:20:06,000000 --> 0:20:06,990000
They started to measure us from behind.

379
0:20:08,000000 --> 0:20:08,990000
They were prepared. We saw the stones from behind.

380
0:20:10,000000 --> 0:20:10,990000
We saw them later.

381
0:20:12,000000 --> 0:20:12,990000
They were in the yards.

382
0:20:14,000000 --> 0:20:14,990000
They started shooting from the left, from the right and from the yards.

383
0:20:16,000000 --> 0:20:16,990000
We were in the trench.

384
0:20:18,000000 --> 0:20:18,990000
I decided to take out the pistol and started shooting in the air.

385
0:20:22,000000 --> 0:20:22,990000
I shot between 8 and 10.

386
0:20:24,000000 --> 0:20:24,990000
I shot like I and 10 meters.

387
0:20:25,000000 --> 0:20:25,990000
I shot like I did all my colleagues, because they didn't hear me.

388
0:20:29,000000 --> 0:20:29,990000
They didn't hear the screams, they were deafening the world.

389
0:20:35,000000 --> 0:20:35,990000
Yes, yes, yes.

390
0:20:37,000000 --> 0:20:37,990000
You can't hear the truth.

391
0:20:39,000000 --> 0:20:39,990000
Exactly. And this happened after the rain.

392
0:20:41,000000 --> 0:20:41,990000
I made it like a dead man, with my hand out of the hole.

393
0:20:44,000000 --> 0:20:44,990000
Because it could be neutralized with a stone.

394
0:20:46,000000 --> 0:20:46,990000
When I saw that they were running away from the left and right,

395
0:20:50,000000 --> 0:20:50,990000
they were running away from the front,

396
0:20:52,000000 --> 0:20:52,990000
I stopped shooting.

397
0:20:54,000000 --> 0:20:54,990000
So they were running away a little bit?

398
0:20:57,000000 --> 0:20:57,990000
Yes, they started running a lot.

399
0:20:59,000000 --> 0:20:59,990000
Because they didn't know if they were shooting at meat or not.

400
0:21:01,000000 --> 0:21:01,990000
Yes, exactly. But I shot them intensively.

401
0:21:04,000000 --> 0:21:04,990000
They are not full, because they were very intensive. They were very full, because it was a very large patrol.

402
0:21:08,000000 --> 0:21:08,990000
There were about 10 people in the squadron.

403
0:21:12,000000 --> 0:21:12,990000
We had about 80 people.

404
0:21:16,000000 --> 0:21:16,990000
Everything was in the field.

405
0:21:18,000000 --> 0:21:18,990000
25 years ago we had a terrible war.

406
0:21:22,000000 --> 0:21:22,990000
We had it thanks to our Turks. They are humble and hardworking people.

407
0:21:27,000000 --> 0:21:27,990000
I know them. But they are also people who know that they do not want their roots to be cut off and their name to be taken away.

408
0:21:33,000000 --> 0:21:33,990000
Some God, whether Allah or Savo, then saved us from a great trouble, from a Serbian trouble.

409
0:21:38,000000 --> 0:21:38,990000
They can not think what could happen.

410
0:21:40,000000 --> 0:21:40,990000
After the advertisements, the story of the medic part directly in the recovery process continues. The city of the revolution The story of the revolution The story of the revolution

411
0:22:26,000000 --> 0:22:26,990000
The story of the revolution

412
0:22:28,000000 --> 0:22:28,990000
The story of the revolution

413
0:22:30,000000 --> 0:22:30,990000
Back then there were no newspapers during the revolution.

414
0:22:32,000000 --> 0:22:32,990000
Back then the TV broadcasted operas and reports on economic successes.

415
0:22:36,000000 --> 0:22:36,990000
Not like now. Everything was positive.

416
0:22:38,000000 --> 0:22:38,990000
We were children and we didn't know that somewhere in Rodopita and somewhere in Dulovo blood was poured and bones were broken.

417
0:22:45,000000 --> 0:22:45,990000
I continue the story of a medic who took part in the revival process.

418
0:22:49,000000 --> 0:22:49,990000
He was ordered to clean up.

419
0:22:51,000000 --> 0:22:51,990000
Where are the trucks? The people from the State Security who did this are still alive.

420
0:22:56,000000 --> 0:22:56,990000
And until today these people are silent.

421
0:22:59,000000 --> 0:22:59,990000
What happened when they fled?

422
0:23:02,000000 --> 0:23:02,990000
The people fled. They ordered ordered to go to Degup.

423
0:23:06,000000 --> 0:23:06,990000
But no one died.

424
0:23:09,000000 --> 0:23:09,990000
The chiefs have their hands full.

425
0:23:11,000000 --> 0:23:11,990000
We started to turn the radio stations, we started to receive orders.

426
0:23:15,000000 --> 0:23:15,990000
Then a man, whom I didn't know, came to me.

427
0:23:18,000000 --> 0:23:18,990000
I don't know where he was.

428
0:23:20,000000 --> 0:23:20,990000
But did he show up?

429
0:23:22,000000 --> 0:23:22,990000
He did.

430
0:23:23,000000 --> 0:23:23,990000
How did he show up?

431
0:23:24,000000 --> 0:23:24,990000
Well, he thought he was holding a violence.

432
0:23:26,000000 --> 0:23:26,990000
He told us like this.

433
0:23:28,000000 --> 0:23:28,990000
Where are you from?

434
0:23:30,000000 --> 0:23:30,990000
Yes, he told us like this.

435
0:23:32,000000 --> 0:23:32,990000
He gathered us in a group and told us that we had to see if there were people in these houses.

436
0:23:36,000000 --> 0:23:36,990000
This is called cleaning. I didn't take it.

437
0:23:38,000000 --> 0:23:38,990000
He didn't call it cleaning.

438
0:23:40,000000 --> 0:23:40,990000
So, everyone who is in the houses, opens their trucks and they know where to drive them.

439
0:23:44,000000 --> 0:23:44,990000
That's for the problem.

440
0:23:45,000000 --> 0:23:45,990000
Yes. I say, wait a minute. What do we do with these people? What do we do?

441
0:23:48,000000 --> 0:23:48,990000
What have we done? They haven't done anything.

442
0:23:49,000000 --> 0:23:49,990000
Hey boy, fill up the water. You have no right to wash.

443
0:23:54,000000 --> 0:23:54,990000
Okay, good.

444
0:23:55,000000 --> 0:23:55,990000
Okay, today I will go to him and tell him.

445
0:23:58,000000 --> 0:23:58,990000
You will tell them the following thing.

446
0:23:59,000000 --> 0:23:59,990000
That if everyone goes to Turkey, if you return, you will be beaten.

447
0:24:04,000000 --> 0:24:04,990000
Wait, what? Turkey is forbidden to go there? If all of them go back to Turkey, they will be beaten up.

448
0:24:08,000000 --> 0:24:08,990000
Wait, what Turkey? Turkey is forbidden to go there. They are interested in this job, you are telling a lot, boy.

449
0:24:11,000000 --> 0:24:11,990000
Okay, I'm telling a lot.

450
0:24:14,000000 --> 0:24:14,990000
I have told a lot in the school and in the club, but I will tell the truth.

451
0:24:19,000000 --> 0:24:19,990000
I have been uncomfortable.

452
0:24:21,000000 --> 0:24:21,990000
So, you take me to your house on the left.

453
0:24:24,000000 --> 0:24:24,990000
You take me to your house on the left. We entered the houses on the left.

454
0:24:26,000000 --> 0:24:26,990000
The houses are in this alley.

455
0:24:27,000000 --> 0:24:27,990000
Yes, so here is the stop, here is the right one.

456
0:24:30,000000 --> 0:24:30,990000
We go back and enter the houses.

457
0:24:32,000000 --> 0:24:32,990000
We enter the houses and start looking for people.

458
0:24:35,000000 --> 0:24:35,990000
How are they? What are they? We find them.

459
0:24:37,000000 --> 0:24:37,990000
They are lying in the closet.

460
0:24:38,000000 --> 0:24:38,990000
What kind of people were they?

461
0:24:40,000000 --> 0:24:40,990000
Well, elderly people.

462
0:24:41,000000 --> 0:24:41,990000
Elderly women with scarves, scarves, even Bulgarian ones.

463
0:24:47,000000 --> 0:24:47,990000
They were all angry.

464
0:24:48,000000 --> 0:24:48,990000
And what did they do?

465
0:24:49,000000 --> 0:24:49,990000
They came from behind another building, they hit, they fought.

466
0:24:53,000000 --> 0:24:53,990000
Wait, you say it very carefully. Did you beat them?

467
0:24:55,000000 --> 0:24:55,990000
To be honest, I was in my house, I went to the fire department to tell them a lot,

468
0:25:00,000000 --> 0:25:00,990000
you can take as much as you want.

469
0:25:02,000000 --> 0:25:02,990000
But you said, come out.

470
0:25:04,000000 --> 0:25:04,990000
Come out, go. I said, who said, get out?

471
0:25:05,000000 --> 0:25:05,990000
Come out, go. I said, I'm at home, there's no one to do the house.

472
0:25:08,000000 --> 0:25:08,990000
Fight outside. There is no explanation, no one gave an explanation for anything.

473
0:25:12,000000 --> 0:25:12,990000
Fight, fight and outside.

474
0:25:14,000000 --> 0:25:14,990000
The trucks are waiting for them.

475
0:25:16,000000 --> 0:25:16,990000
Because they talk. When they talk, they are against us.

476
0:25:19,000000 --> 0:25:19,990000
Come on, go to the truck.

477
0:25:21,000000 --> 0:25:21,990000
A military truck, for example, you know, you throw the trucks, they jump up, they throw throwing potatoes up, and so they cleaned themselves about 5-6 hours before the end of the day.

478
0:25:29,000000 --> 0:25:29,990000
Did they have blood?

479
0:25:30,000000 --> 0:25:30,990000
We didn't have much blood.

480
0:25:32,000000 --> 0:25:32,990000
We didn't have much blood.

481
0:25:34,000000 --> 0:25:34,990000
Exactly, we didn't have much blood.

482
0:25:36,000000 --> 0:25:36,990000
But a colleague, who had left a Bulgarian house, he was taken and we sent him to the hospital.

483
0:25:46,000000 --> 0:25:46,990000
From there we realized that things were not according to plan.

484
0:25:52,000000 --> 0:25:52,990000
But the situation is still inside the building.

485
0:25:56,000000 --> 0:25:56,990000
After we finished cleaning this area, we entered the building.

486
0:26:02,000000 --> 0:26:02,990000
There the things were was out of control. What did you see?

487
0:26:06,000000 --> 0:26:06,990000
I saw animals that had run to the ground, about 30-50 people.

488
0:26:10,000000 --> 0:26:10,990000
The blood was pouring like a river.

489
0:26:13,000000 --> 0:26:13,990000
I didn't see what was happening, but I saw the result.

490
0:26:18,000000 --> 0:26:18,990000
Stinging people, suffering from pain.

491
0:26:22,000000 --> 0:26:22,990000
No help. The one who asked wanted help received more than the regulator.

492
0:26:28,000000 --> 0:26:28,990000
The one who was silent, you are doing a roll call, you are silent, fight!

493
0:26:32,000000 --> 0:26:32,990000
And he? And he. So you are silent once, fight, and you speak once, even more fight.

494
0:26:36,000000 --> 0:26:36,990000
If you want a doctor, the doctor is with the cup on his head.

495
0:26:40,000000 --> 0:26:40,990000
The situation was out of control.

496
0:26:44,000000 --> 0:26:44,990000
I see my colleagues as animals, but not as servants of the MGR.

497
0:26:48,000000 --> 0:26:48,990000
There were no laws. And if I wanted to help one of them, I would have received a beating too. That was the situation.

498
0:26:57,000000 --> 0:26:57,990000
So, your Dramini was holding the Bulgarian side, the Bulgarian police?

499
0:27:01,000000 --> 0:27:01,990000
That was something abnormal.

500
0:27:03,000000 --> 0:27:03,990000
Or you already saw that something bad was happening?

501
0:27:05,000000 --> 0:27:05,990000
Wait, this is not normal.

502
0:27:07,000000 --> 0:27:07,990000
We neutralized some police officers who were against the constitution and law.

503
0:27:12,000000 --> 0:27:12,990000
We neutralized them. Why did we have to kill them?

504
0:27:16,000000 --> 0:27:16,990000
Why? They were tied with a rope, neutralized, they jumped with their heads in the water.

505
0:27:21,000000 --> 0:27:21,990000
You understand me? A madhouse, a full madhouse.

506
0:27:24,000000 --> 0:27:24,990000
Things escalated.

507
0:27:26,000000 --> 0:27:26,990000
And the way they did it first, this is not normal, this is animalistic.

508
0:27:30,000000 --> 0:27:30,990000
Animalistic, it doesn't matter that I was the hero. I said this is not normal.

509
0:27:35,000000 --> 0:27:35,990000
I was the hero of the day, because with my actions we broke this crowd.

510
0:27:40,000000 --> 0:27:40,990000
No one gave any instructions what to do. But you can't do this,

511
0:27:44,000000 --> 0:27:44,990000
to neutralize people who want the rights.

512
0:27:46,000000 --> 0:27:46,990000
There is no way to do it. This is genocide.

513
0:27:49,000000 --> 0:27:49,990000
But there were no corpses?

514
0:27:51,000000 --> 0:27:51,990000
There were no corpses.

515
0:27:53,000000 --> 0:27:53,990000
Were there dead or alive?

516
0:27:54,000000 --> 0:27:54,990000
Instead of when I was there, there were wounded who were unconscious.

517
0:27:58,000000 --> 0:27:58,990000
Those we were throwing water at, those we were beating adrenaline.

518
0:28:02,000000 --> 0:28:02,990000
Which, for example, from fighting, gives you the ability to sleep without consciousness.

519
0:28:06,000000 --> 0:28:06,990000
You fight so much that you can't sleep without consciousness.

520
0:28:09,000000 --> 0:28:09,990000
It takes only seconds and you get stuck again.

521
0:28:12,000000 --> 0:28:12,990000
What happened? They were on the verge of death.

522
0:28:14,000000 --> 0:28:14,990000
They were with these twins, they were used.

523
0:28:19,000000 --> 0:28:19,990000
Why did you have to kill them? Why did you continue to kill them?

524
0:28:23,000000 --> 0:28:23,990000
How long did they beat you? 40 minutes, maybe an hour or two.

525
0:28:26,000000 --> 0:28:26,990000
With blood.

526
0:28:28,000000 --> 0:28:28,990000
I have never seen so much blood in my life.

527
0:28:30,000000 --> 0:28:30,990000
They killed many people.

528
0:28:32,000000 --> 0:28:32,990000
I can't tell you exactly one of the fights.

529
0:28:34,000000 --> 0:28:34,990000
Here is the bathhouse. I have been there for a long time.

530
0:28:36,000000 --> 0:28:36,990000
They killed about 80 people from the bathhouse.

531
0:28:38,000000 --> 0:28:38,990000
They were making a mess.

532
0:28:40,000000 --> 0:28:40,990000
Those who were covered in blood,

533
0:28:42,000000 --> 0:28:42,990000
maybe they were imams, I can't imagine.

534
0:28:44,000000 --> 0:28:44,990000
They became a great thing.

535
0:28:47,000000 --> 0:28:47,990000
A madman, a complete madman.

536
0:28:49,000000 --> 0:28:49,990000
I will tell you, for example, the police sticks were broken in two.

537
0:28:53,000000 --> 0:28:53,990000
Inside they have a very metal base, they broke in two.

538
0:28:57,000000 --> 0:28:57,990000
There were sticks that were made of rubber, they are very hard rubber, they broke the stick in two, from the black hit, from the black hits, they hit the body, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard, they are very hard I was bleeding, the whole body was bleeding, the whole body was bleeding, you understand? This is not normal. Why? Because it was not good for anyone to do this.

539
0:29:28,000000 --> 0:29:28,990000
But you think so now, then you didn't think so?

540
0:29:30,000000 --> 0:29:30,990000
I thought so again. Believe me, I thought so again.

541
0:29:33,000000 --> 0:29:33,990000
The human in me was on the ground, but I could not change anything.

542
0:29:36,000000 --> 0:29:36,990000
Well, you say about your blows, you also gave up.

543
0:29:39,000000 --> 0:29:39,990000
Yes, I gave up blows to those who were outside, houses.

544
0:29:42,000000 --> 0:29:42,990000
Do you remember any of the eyes, the victims?

545
0:29:44,000000 --> 0:29:44,990000
I can't tell you honestly.

546
0:29:45,000000 --> 0:29:45,990000
Old people were somewhere, somewhere out of the blue.

547
0:29:48,000000 --> 0:29:48,990000
I hit myself, people hit me.

548
0:29:50,000000 --> 0:29:50,990000
For example, here is a man who was completely blind,

549
0:29:53,000000 --> 0:29:53,990000
I can't imagine him, about 55 years old, blind.

550
0:29:56,000000 --> 0:29:56,990000
What can I tell you, a madman.

551
0:29:58,000000 --> 0:29:58,990000
I personally tell you honestly, if I hit him 2 meters,

552
0:30:00,000000 --> 0:30:00,990000
I will tell you I'm crazy, maybe I'm crazy.

553
0:30:02,000000 --> 0:30:02,990000
Because I didn't need such a thing.

554
0:30:04,000000 --> 0:30:04,990000
I didn't need it, just know. I'm telling you, everyone was beaten to death hospital. I didn't need to do that. I didn't need to do that.

555
0:30:06,000000 --> 0:30:06,990000
So, everyone was beaten to death, but you didn't.

556
0:30:08,000000 --> 0:30:08,990000
I am telling the truth.

557
0:30:10,000000 --> 0:30:10,990000
I hit two or three people,

558
0:30:12,000000 --> 0:30:12,990000
but it wasn't an escalation.

559
0:30:14,000000 --> 0:30:14,990000
You didn't hit them?

560
0:30:16,000000 --> 0:30:16,990000
No. I shot.

561
0:30:18,000000 --> 0:30:18,990000
I admit I used the weapon.

562
0:30:20,000000 --> 0:30:20,990000
I used the weapon

563
0:30:22,000000 --> 0:30:22,990000
and thanks to that weapon

564
0:30:24,000000 --> 0:30:24,990000
they were neutralized.

565
0:30:26,000000 --> 0:30:26,990000
So we were going to win. Maybe we were going to take their place,

566
0:30:30,000000 --> 0:30:30,990000
as I am now, if it had not been done.

567
0:30:32,000000 --> 0:30:32,990000
I was smart, but not in the way I saw my colleagues do.

568
0:30:36,000000 --> 0:30:36,990000
Could you negotiate with them?

569
0:30:38,000000 --> 0:30:38,990000
No, no negotiations. Everything is better decided by the government.

570
0:30:42,000000 --> 0:30:42,990000
The goal was to take them down and to sell them to by the government. By the state? So you can beat them and scare them? Yes. The goal was to beat them, to persuade them to leave the state.

571
0:30:48,000000 --> 0:30:48,990000
This was the goal. We didn't know it.

572
0:30:50,000000 --> 0:30:50,990000
But how do you force them to leave the state when you just kill them?

573
0:30:52,000000 --> 0:30:52,990000
You tell them to go to Turkey.

574
0:30:54,000000 --> 0:30:54,990000
We told them to go to Turkey, otherwise we will kill all of them.

575
0:30:56,000000 --> 0:30:56,990000
You kill them until you kill them.

576
0:30:58,000000 --> 0:30:58,990000
We beat them on an ethnic basis. All types of beating.

577
0:31:01,000000 --> 0:31:01,990000
Your mother is Turkish, you know what you are thinking?

578
0:31:04,000000 --> 0:31:04,990000
What do you think? What is a muci? A muci, for example, is a Turkish. All types of This was politics, because they opened borders. This was planned, we didn't know it.

579
0:31:26,000000 --> 0:31:26,990000
The state security told them to go to Turkey,

580
0:31:29,000000 --> 0:31:29,990000
if they return, they will be beaten to death.

581
0:31:32,000000 --> 0:31:32,990000
I said, how will they be beaten?

582
0:31:35,000000 --> 0:31:35,990000
This is not your business, boy.

583
0:31:38,000000 --> 0:31:38,990000
This is what the state security told me.

584
0:31:41,000000 --> 0:31:41,990000
I look back and say, they have used us.

585
0:31:44,000000 --> 0:31:44,990000
They knew they would opening the borders.

586
0:31:45,600000 --> 0:31:51,200000
The question was to be able to put pressure on them, how much more Turkey can be exhausted in a month.

587
0:31:51,200000 --> 0:31:54
How much more? That was their goal.

588
0:31:54,000000 --> 0:31:54,990000
To put us in a regional conflict with Turkey.

589
0:31:57,000000 --> 0:31:57,990000
This is the war of the great powers, Russia and America, or the USSR and America.

590
0:32:00,800000 --> 0:32:02,800000
To put us in conflict. And this happened.

591
0:32:02,800000 --> 0:32:06
These 360,000 people who came to Turkey for one month,

592
0:32:06,000000 --> 0:32:06,990000
they brought a collapse to the Turkish economy.

593
0:32:08,000000 --> 0:32:08,990000
That's why the inflation was so high.

594
0:32:10,000000 --> 0:32:10,990000
This is later.

595
0:32:12,000000 --> 0:32:12,990000
How did this day end?

596
0:32:14,000000 --> 0:32:14,990000
Was it at night?

597
0:32:16,000000 --> 0:32:16,990000
No, it was around 5.30-6.

598
0:32:18,000000 --> 0:32:18,990000
The evening was somewhere.

599
0:32:20,000000 --> 0:32:20,990000
This is daytime, not nighttime.

600
0:32:22,000000 --> 0:32:22,990000
Yes, it is not nighttime.

601
0:32:24,000000 --> 0:32:24,990000
Not at all. All these people were taken away. So this was daytime, not nighttime. Yes, it was nighttime, not the morning. After that all of these were brought,

602
0:32:26,000000 --> 0:32:26,990000
with trucks loaded with lorries,

603
0:32:28,000000 --> 0:32:28,990000
with lorries thrown, taken...

604
0:32:30,000000 --> 0:32:30,990000
Where?

605
0:32:32,000000 --> 0:32:32,990000
In the fire safety area.

606
0:32:34,000000 --> 0:32:34,990000
In the fire?

607
0:32:36,000000 --> 0:32:36,990000
Yes, in the fire.

608
0:32:38,000000 --> 0:32:38,990000
But what was in the fire safety area

609
0:32:40,000000 --> 0:32:40,990000
was the fire.

610
0:32:42,000000 --> 0:32:42,990000
In the fire, you say?

611
0:32:44,000000 --> 0:32:44,990000
Yes, in the fire. You get inside, you could see the fire under the letter P, the letter P, the people on the ground with their heads against the wall, those who were helplessly lying on the ground.

612
0:32:54,000000 --> 0:32:54,990000
You could see the pain, the people who had more eyes, more blood, and there was a fire inside.

613
0:33:00,000000 --> 0:33:00,990000
They closed the doors, put two troops in front and that was it.

614
0:33:07,000000 --> 0:33:07,990000
Did they want to see you in the evening?

615
0:33:09,000000 --> 0:33:09,990000
No, no one wanted to see me in the evening. The internal troops were dispossessed in Razga and there were about 7-8 boys.

616
0:33:15,000000 --> 0:33:15,990000
That's it. They put me in front.

617
0:33:17,000000 --> 0:33:17,990000
But the BTR with Tom Imanache were up and all the units?

618
0:33:19,000000 --> 0:33:19,990000
Yes. There was a BTR and I don't know why they sent us. I have no know. I am a member of the Sector Cut.

619
0:33:25,500000 --> 0:33:29
What is the problem with the production process? Why did they send us there?

620
0:33:29,000000 --> 0:33:29,990000
We asked ourselves this question. Why did they send us there?

621
0:33:31,500000 --> 0:33:33,500000
There is a common ground. There is no common ground with us.

622
0:33:33,500000 --> 0:33:36,500000
We are not the people who can solve these things. We are the public.

623
0:33:36,500000 --> 0:33:38,500000
Who wants to send us according to you?

624
0:33:38,500000 --> 0:33:43,500000
Those who are familiar with the internal muscles. They created internal muscles.

625
0:33:43,500000 --> 0:33:46
They created them. They are internal muscles. What happened them, they are exactly internal.

626
0:33:46,000000 --> 0:33:46,990000
What happened on the third day? They sent 20 people.

627
0:33:49,000000 --> 0:33:49,990000
We have no information. I will only tell you what happened after us.

628
0:33:52,000000 --> 0:33:52,990000
So what happened? They told us that all consumers who are not party members,

629
0:33:57,000000 --> 0:33:57,990000
we will be transferred to Russia. Only party members remain in the evening.

630
0:34:03,000000 --> 0:34:03,990000
Now I learned from them that there were martyrs there.

631
0:34:08,000000 --> 0:34:08,990000
I can't tell you how true it is, but I know there is a monument in Dulovo.

632
0:34:12,000000 --> 0:34:12,990000
They told me that those who were killed were the ones who died from their wounds.

633
0:34:16,000000 --> 0:34:16,990000
I can't tell you how true it is, but there is no information on the Internet.

634
0:34:20,000000 --> 0:34:20,990000
Only in Dulovo it is written that there was a rally of the medical forces

635
0:34:24,000000 --> 0:34:24,990000
with the protesters. There is no says that there is a clash of the mercenary forces with the protesters.

636
0:34:25,000000 --> 0:34:25,990000
There is no case that the problem has been reached, for example, that it started from the fight we had today.

637
0:34:30,000000 --> 0:34:30,990000
While in the village of Ezerche, a few days, two days later, there were killed three or four people, that's what it says on the internet.

638
0:34:38,000000 --> 0:34:38,990000
But from the fight?

639
0:34:39,000000 --> 0:34:39,990000
They say that it was an accidental crash, but we know what happened there.

640
0:34:43,000000 --> 0:34:43,990000
From the bottom and from Ezerche, the escalation of tension opened the border immediately with Turkey.

641
0:34:49,000000 --> 0:34:49,990000
To exit.

642
0:34:50,000000 --> 0:34:50,990000
Yes, one month after that.

643
0:34:52,000000 --> 0:34:52,990000
Do you feel the wine now?

644
0:34:54,000000 --> 0:34:54,990000
Of course I feel the wine.

645
0:34:56,000000 --> 0:34:56,990000
So many years later.

646
0:34:58,000000 --> 0:34:58,990000
I wanted to say it much sooner.

647
0:34:59,000000 --> 0:34:59,990000
Didn't you want to say, I was right, or that was the time?

648
0:35:04,000000 --> 0:35:04,990000
We were never right.

649
0:35:05,000000 --> 0:35:05,990000
You were never right to beat them?

650
0:35:07,000000 --> 0:35:07,990000
Never.

651
0:35:08,000000 --> 0:35:08,990000
But you fulfilled your oath, this can justify it.

652
0:35:11,000000 --> 0:35:11,990000
I fulfilled my oath against the Constitution.

653
0:35:14,000000 --> 0:35:14,990000
The violation of human rights.

654
0:35:16,000000 --> 0:35:16,990000
Then you know what was the Constitution, it was the party in the end.

655
0:35:19,000000 --> 0:35:19,990000
They put us in a trap.

656
0:35:21,000000 --> 0:35:21,990000
They sent us to the victim's prison.

657
0:35:24,000000 --> 0:35:24,990000
But you were the victims, you were to the prison. They sent us to a victim's prison. But you were the victims. Weren't you the victims?

658
0:35:27,000000 --> 0:35:27,990000
Because they opposed our ethnicity against the people, against the police.

659
0:35:31,000000 --> 0:35:31,990000
They opposed the people who wanted sacred things, the human things.

660
0:35:36,000000 --> 0:35:36,990000
The name was given to them from the Holy Spirit.

661
0:35:38,000000 --> 0:35:38,990000
We had that. We had the honor and dignity of citizens who feel part of the Bulgarian people.

662
0:35:44,000000 --> 0:35:44,990000
of citizens who feel they are part of the Bulgarian people.

663
0:35:47,000000 --> 0:35:47,990000
For example, a representative of mine comes to my house and says to me, you say to yourself today, Hasan, come to me, go away,

664
0:35:50,000000 --> 0:35:50,990000
how will you work for me?

665
0:35:52,000000 --> 0:35:52,990000
I just say to myself, how to be Hasan, or for me, the second.

666
0:35:55,000000 --> 0:35:55,990000
Hypothetically, I say to myself, how do you feel every Bulgarian citizen?

667
0:35:59,000000 --> 0:35:59,990000
And those people who made the most difficult process,

668
0:36:02,000000 --> 0:36:02,990000
and those who donated millions and a half of Bulgaria,

669
0:36:04,000000 --> 0:36:04,990000
leave Bulgaria, are the same people.

670
0:36:06,000000 --> 0:36:06,990000
They used force methods, now with economic and political slavery.

671
0:36:11,000000 --> 0:36:11,990000
They forced one million and a half Bulgarians to leave their homeland and become slaves in other countries.

672
0:36:18,000000 --> 0:36:18,990000
People are the same. That's why I'm provoked by this thing.

673
0:36:21,000000 --> 0:36:21,990000
You can't admit it because the state can't be improved in the same way.

674
0:36:26,000000 --> 0:36:26,990000
I want to say one thing to the Bulgarian people.

675
0:36:28,000000 --> 0:36:28,990000
Don't be fooled by bigger Turks than the Turks.

676
0:36:32,000000 --> 0:36:32,990000
I'll tell you why.

677
0:36:34,000000 --> 0:36:34,990000
Because I've been to Turkey many times.

678
0:36:36,000000 --> 0:36:36,990000
And I know what the real Turks are like to you.

679
0:36:39,000000 --> 0:36:39,990000
You are Bulgarians there and you are peasants there.

680
0:36:42,000000 --> 0:36:42,990000
Yes, but here they are Turks.

681
0:36:43,000000 --> 0:36:43,990000
Ah, this is the Gnostic deception.

682
0:36:46,000000 --> 0:36:46,990000
They claim that they are Turkish citizens,

683
0:36:48,000000 --> 0:36:48,990000
and there they call them Bulgarians and peasants.

684
0:36:50,000000 --> 0:36:50,990000
Stop acting like you are not.

685
0:36:52,000000 --> 0:36:52,990000
So you are saying that there are no Turks?

686
0:36:54,000000 --> 0:36:54,990000
There are no Turks.

687
0:36:56,000000 --> 0:36:56,990000
There are peasants.

688
0:36:58,000000 --> 0:36:58,990000
They are called Bulgarians.

689
0:37:00,000000 --> 0:37:00,990000
Proshka, do you want to ask?

690
0:37:06,000000 --> 0:37:06,990000
Of course I want to ask for a kiss.

691
0:37:08,000000 --> 0:37:08,990000
I know how I would feel if someone would do such a thing to me.

692
0:37:11,000000 --> 0:37:11,990000
From whom? For example, when you meet people downstairs?

693
0:37:15,000000 --> 0:37:15,990000
No, I can't tell you. I don't know anyone there.

694
0:37:18,000000 --> 0:37:18,990000
I've met people with a small football team when I had such a big goal to play.

695
0:37:22,000000 --> 0:37:22,990000
I've never even mentioned it to anyone because I'm ashamed of it.

696
0:37:25,000000 --> 0:37:25,990000
I'm ashamed and sorry.

697
0:37:27,000000 --> 0:37:27,990000
What happened later, after you killed them, after you moved to Russia?

698
0:37:33,000000 --> 0:37:33,990000
After we moved to Russia, we, at least the whole city of Russia,

699
0:37:37,000000 --> 0:37:37,990000
we maintain relations with many people. We are on the way.

700
0:37:40,000000 --> 0:37:40,990000
We started to tell the truth. The whole city understood what had happened.

701
0:37:43,000000 --> 0:37:43,990000
We were immediately neutralized the authorities to sign a declaration that we won't tell more about the

702
0:37:45,260000 --> 0:37:51,260000
incitement.

703
0:37:51,260000 --> 0:37:54,260000
So you signed it after the incident, so you wouldn't tell how you were beaten?

704
0:37:54,260000 --> 0:37:57,260000
Exactly. The whole town said that the prisoners told the truth.

705
0:37:57,260000 --> 0:38:00,260000
And it reached Sofia, to the Minister of Internal Affairs.

706
0:38:00,260000 --> 0:38:04,260000
And from there we were immediately authorized with a declaration, a sign, that if someone says a word

707
0:38:04,260000 --> 0:38:06
about the resurrection process,

708
0:38:06,000000 --> 0:38:06,990000
all the consequences for the release of the state secret will be borne.

709
0:38:10,000000 --> 0:38:10,990000
I am a father of two children. What can you do? Nothing.

710
0:38:14,000000 --> 0:38:14,990000
Do you ever dream?

711
0:38:20,000000 --> 0:38:20,990000
Many times.

712
0:38:21,000000 --> 0:38:21,990000
What do you dream about?

713
0:38:23,000000 --> 0:38:23,990000
I dream about the blood.

714
0:38:25,000000 --> 0:38:25,990000
I was in all my life.

715
0:38:27,000000 --> 0:38:27,990000
To be so obsessed with memory, 23 years I was in the blood, I was in the blood, I was in the blood.

716
0:38:32,000000 --> 0:38:32,990000
Everything was here and there.

717
0:38:34,000000 --> 0:38:34,990000
When did you stop being a medic?

718
0:38:36,000000 --> 0:38:36,990000
In 4 years.

719
0:38:38,000000 --> 0:38:38,990000
I quit the subject in 1992.

720
0:38:41,000000 --> 0:38:41,990000
I quit and went to the protests, because everything that was done, the evil in me,

721
0:38:44,000000 --> 0:38:44,990000
when they are done, and until a little while nothing has changed. I was 22. I left him to protest, because everything that was done to me, the evil that was done to me,

722
0:38:45,000000 --> 0:38:45,990000
and until recently nothing has changed.

723
0:38:48,000000 --> 0:38:48,990000
But some people still claim that you are a bandit, that you are involved in illegal things.

724
0:38:53,000000 --> 0:38:53,990000
I'm glad. I'm glad that it's like that.

725
0:38:57,000000 --> 0:38:57,990000
I'm glad that I'm telling you something. I have never taken any How would you come to such a meeting? I would come there, I would look into the eyes when I speak.

726
0:39:26,000000 --> 0:39:26,990000
I would look into the eyes and ask for forgiveness.

727
0:39:29,000000 --> 0:39:29,990000
Even for actions that I have not performed, I would ask for forgiveness.

728
0:39:32,000000 --> 0:39:32,990000
Because what we did was disgusting.

729
0:39:35,000000 --> 0:39:35,990000
This was cruelty, also only for the animals, the predators.

730
0:39:39,000000 --> 0:39:39,990000
This cannot be a behavior of people who, for example, protect the interests of the people,

731
0:39:44,000000 --> 0:39:44,990000
as we are the citizens, we are the slaves of the people.

732
0:39:47,400000 --> 0:39:49,400000
Nothing is true.

733
0:39:49,400000 --> 0:39:52,400000
We protect the interests of the Party of the Policheska Party,

734
0:39:52,400000 --> 0:39:54,400000
and only their interests.

735
0:39:54,400000 --> 0:39:57,400000
And we keep the masses in obedience and sovereignty.

736
0:39:57,400000 --> 0:40:01,400000
Where are these people now, your bosses?

737
0:40:01,400000 --> 0:40:04,400000
Did the militant people die since then?

738
0:40:04,400000 --> 0:40:06
I think they are still alive and healthy.

739
0:40:06,000000 --> 0:40:06,990000
They are alive and healthy.

740
0:40:08,000000 --> 0:40:08,990000
Even, I will tell you, Alexander Stefanov,

741
0:40:10,000000 --> 0:40:10,990000
the head of the state security,

742
0:40:12,000000 --> 0:40:12,990000
was also the head of the district for many years.

743
0:40:15,000000 --> 0:40:15,990000
During the time of democracy?

744
0:40:16,000000 --> 0:40:16,990000
Yes, during the time of democracy.

745
0:40:17,000000 --> 0:40:17,990000
He was appointed, I think, from 1975 to 1998.

746
0:40:20,000000 --> 0:40:20,990000
They appointed him twice.

747
0:40:21,000000 --> 0:40:21,990000
Once he was head of the police, once the head of the police.

748
0:40:23,000000 --> 0:40:23,990000
We are back to the state security. They continued to rule after 1989. They are beaten twice. Once they were beaten, once they were beaten. We are back to the state security.

749
0:40:25,000000 --> 0:40:25,990000
Absolutely.

750
0:40:26,000000 --> 0:40:26,990000
They continued to rule after 1989.

751
0:40:27,000000 --> 0:40:27,990000
They are still here.

752
0:40:28,000000 --> 0:40:28,990000
These are the people who had issued an order to beat.

753
0:40:30,000000 --> 0:40:30,990000
Exactly.

754
0:40:31,000000 --> 0:40:31,990000
Comment on them.

755
0:40:32,000000 --> 0:40:32,990000
They are here. They are here and nothing has happened to them.

756
0:40:35,000000 --> 0:40:35,990000
There is no interest in the political parties at the moment, in the electoral process, to put the truth on the table.

757
0:40:40,000000 --> 0:40:40,990000
This is a fact from all political parties.

758
0:40:43,000000 --> 0:40:43,990000
Why don't we once and for all put an end to this process?

759
0:40:48,000000 --> 0:40:48,990000
Once and for all tell the truth. And I will tell you something else.

760
0:40:51,000000 --> 0:40:51,990000
If I meet the Turkish prime minister now, with these self-confessions, I will tell him this.

761
0:40:55,000000 --> 0:40:55,990000
Mr. Erdogan, if now I gave the opportunity to all Bulgarian people to get compensation for what we have done, that is, the atrocities we have committed,

762
0:41:07,500000 --> 0:41:11,500000
you will now receive compensation for what you have done,

763
0:41:11,500000 --> 0:41:13,580000
that is, justice, however, you will be given a Bulgarian

764
0:41:13,580000 --> 0:41:17
medal, whatever, with a village badge, with a Turkish passport,

765
0:41:17,000000 --> 0:41:17,990000
but we will also claim for the death of my grandmother in 1906,

766
0:41:20,000000 --> 0:41:20,990000
because my great grandmother lost her property and lost her life.

767
0:41:23,000000 --> 0:41:23,990000
So you want to say that you admit your sin, but the Turks admit their sins too?

768
0:41:28,000000 --> 0:41:28,990000
Absolutely. We can admit what we have done for 23 years, but they have to admit that they are the Bulgarians who were besieged by the Black Sea.

769
0:41:37,000000 --> 0:41:37,990000
Yes, I know that.

770
0:41:38,000000 --> 0:41:38,990000
A million Bulgarians, the Solitude, the Socialism and so on. They have to admit it too.

771
0:41:43,000000 --> 0:41:43,990000
With my own confession, I admit it. I understand your thesis and why you do this.

772
0:41:46,000000 --> 0:41:46,990000
You want to have justice from one side and from the other.

773
0:41:48,000000 --> 0:41:48,990000
Exactly.

774
0:41:50,000000 --> 0:41:50,990000
We have to admit our mistakes in the process of purification.

775
0:41:52,000000 --> 0:41:52,990000
And they have to admit the purification of the Odrin's church.

776
0:41:54,000000 --> 0:41:54,990000
Exactly. This is the path of the conversion.

777
0:41:56,000000 --> 0:41:56,990000
This is the path of the humiliation of the priest.

778
0:41:58,000000 --> 0:41:58,990000
So you can't admit something,

779
0:42:00,000000 --> 0:42:00,990000
and the other person can't admit it.

780
0:42:02,000000 --> 0:42:02,990000
You can't. We want to admit the purification in Odrin,

781
0:42:04,000000 --> 0:42:04,990000
but we also admit the process of purification. You can't do that. We want to acknowledge the purgatory in Odrin, but we are not acknowledging the process of the funeral.

782
0:42:06,000000 --> 0:42:06,990000
Aren't we acknowledging too many cases?

783
0:42:08,000000 --> 0:42:08,990000
Because the Turks are just about to admit it.

784
0:42:10,000000 --> 0:42:10,990000
We are obliged to want.

785
0:42:12,000000 --> 0:42:12,990000
We want. We acknowledge it, but we want it.

786
0:42:14,000000 --> 0:42:14,990000
And this is something that I do in the media

787
0:42:16,000000 --> 0:42:16,990000
not because I want to be a hero,

788
0:42:18,000000 --> 0:42:18,990000
no, because some people

789
0:42:20,000000 --> 0:42:20,990000
should get compensation for what we have done.

790
0:42:22,000000 --> 0:42:22,990000
What compensation should they get?

791
0:42:24,000000 --> 0:42:24,990000
Commitment or money? I'm not talking about money. They should receive compensation for what we have done. What compensation?

792
0:42:25,000000 --> 0:42:25,990000
Commitment or money?

793
0:42:27,000000 --> 0:42:27,990000
I am not talking about money.

794
0:42:29,000000 --> 0:42:29,990000
Moral compensation?

795
0:42:30,000000 --> 0:42:30,990000
Exactly.

796
0:42:31,000000 --> 0:42:31,990000
What do you think about the fact that many jami'is are being made?

797
0:42:34,000000 --> 0:42:34,990000
That now with the development process, there is a such a thing?

798
0:42:37,000000 --> 0:42:37,990000
Here we are already going to a completely different topic.

799
0:42:40,000000 --> 0:42:40,990000
What you do, you, the Muhammedans, to the Bulgarians, stop doing it.

800
0:42:44,000000 --> 0:42:44,990000
So if you think that you will make 50, 100 or 200 mosques and in this way you will defend our religion from the Christian Muslim world, you are wrong.

801
0:42:53,000000 --> 0:42:53,990000
I am a partner in a Bulgarian company. I know a lot of friends in Syria and I support them in what is happening.

802
0:42:58,000000 --> 0:42:58,990000
But let me explain. The freedom of religion. But if you think that with religion you will enslave us again, there is no way to do that.

803
0:43:10,000000 --> 0:43:10,990000
This is the gigantic manipulation of Islam at the moment. Here is the opposition of the ethnic groups.

804
0:43:14,000000 --> 0:43:14,990000
They have found themselves in the law of the law, the capital is the Jiminy. They are now, of course, they are not committing hatred.

805
0:43:20,000000 --> 0:43:20,990000
Yes, they are committing, but we don't know what they are saying.

806
0:43:22,000000 --> 0:43:22,990000
Can there be a clash again?

807
0:43:24,000000 --> 0:43:24,990000
I doubt it. Honestly, I doubt it. I don't know what they are saying. Can there be a conflict again? I doubt it.

808
0:43:26,000000 --> 0:43:26,990000
Honestly, I doubt it. Because I can deal with each one of them.

809
0:43:28,000000 --> 0:43:28,990000
I can deal with each one of them.

810
0:43:30,000000 --> 0:43:30,990000
I think that many people like me are on the same page.

811
0:43:32,000000 --> 0:43:32,990000
We can deal with each other, but without politicians.

812
0:43:34,000000 --> 0:43:34,990000
When you are involved in politics and religion, it becomes terrible.

813
0:43:38,000000 --> 0:43:38,990000
When there are no politicians, when there are people like you,

814
0:43:40,000000 --> 0:43:40,990000
when there is a human being, when there is a person like you,

815
0:43:42,000000 --> 0:43:42,990000
you can always deal with each other.

816
0:43:44,000000 --> 0:43:44,990000
But if you have an animal in you't communicate with you, then yes.

817
0:43:48,000000 --> 0:43:48,990000
We owe the debt to the dead and the dead.

818
0:43:52,000000 --> 0:43:52,990000
25 years later, 30 years later, the revolutionary process is used in every way to divide people in Bulgaria.

819
0:43:59,000000 --> 0:43:59,990000
Today, the events are not used by other people, revanchists with Islamic slander.

820
0:44:04,000000 --> 0:44:04,990000
The truth is simple. Everyone should live freely and say what he decides.

821
0:44:08,000000 --> 0:44:08,990000
Everyone should keep the laws of the country and not work against them.

822
0:44:12,000000 --> 0:44:12,990000
Make an honest confession from Russia that he told what we should be ashamed of.

823
0:44:16,000000 --> 0:44:16,990000
And make an honest confession from us to remember and to protect ourselves from our mistakes.

824
0:44:20,000000 --> 0:44:20,990000
From the idiotic mistakes of the Arabian Peninsula.

825
0:44:45,000000 --> 0:44:45,990000
It is the second largest city in the Arabian Peninsula.

826
0:44:50,000000 --> 0:44:50,990000
It is the second largest city in the Arabian Peninsula.

827
0:44:55,000000 --> 0:44:55,990000
It is the third largest city in the Arabian Peninsula.

828
0:45:00,000000 --> 0:45:00,990000
It is the third largest city in the year of the He died in 1989, and this event is long.

829
0:45:30,000000 --> 0:45:30,990000
To be honest, I didn't expect this video to be broadcasted, but after 8 months of recording, it was broadcasted.

830
0:45:43,000000 --> 0:45:43,990000
The recording was taken out. It was broadcast on a TV that we all know is controlled by TPC.

831
0:45:52,000000 --> 0:45:52,990000
The interesting thing is that what I said, almost for everything that happened down there, is broadcasted, but with a little detail.

832
0:46:06,960000 --> 0:46:20,660000
The detail is that my statement about my opinion on DPS and GEP was cut out from the moment of making this material.

833
0:46:20,660000 --> 0:46:27
What is it? My self-confession for my participation in this process is based on a few things.

834
0:46:27,000000 --> 0:46:27,990000
One of them is the decoration of the National Assembly, which was established a few years ago,

835
0:46:32,000000 --> 0:46:32,990000
which admits that the process was a form of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Bulgarian and Bulgarian- are people who sought their rights from some more powerful and more powerful people.

836
0:46:54,000000 --> 0:46:54,990000
My self-knowledge was this self-knowledge, also in the film, the level of my self-knowledge in the world affair, which was published on 20 November 2012.

837
0:47:04,000000 --> 0:47:04,990000
who published them on 20th of November 2012. When the attack of all of us, the Bulgarian fools,

838
0:47:08,000000 --> 0:47:08,990000
in relation to the dictator and his government, Bulgarian Bruce, was very long.

839
0:47:13,000000 --> 0:47:13,990000
On the 19th I can say that I was the representative of the Bulgarian public,

840
0:47:17,000000 --> 0:47:17,990000
I went to Cyprus on the 20th to make my self-recognition before the second affair

841
0:47:22,000000 --> 0:47:22,990000
and there I was published.

842
0:47:24,000000 --> 0:47:24,990000
The comments you see there are very different,

843
0:47:28,000000 --> 0:47:28,990000
colorful, people who are paid,

844
0:47:31,000000 --> 0:47:31,990000
people who are here, from the city,

845
0:47:34,000000 --> 0:47:34,990000
former citizens, but there are some people who say

846
0:47:37,000000 --> 0:47:37,990000
yes, this is not true.

847
0:47:39,000000 --> 0:47:39,990000
And because there, in the site of the fair,

848
0:47:43,000000 --> 0:47:43,990000
there were a lot of comments, and because a lot of people accused me that everything I said was a lie, I decided to continue and to get to the end, to say the truth again on the website.

849
0:47:54,000000 --> 0:47:54,990000
Let those who criticized me on the website, they insulted me, that I was stupid, that I didn't listen to the publications, they took me and said,

850
0:48:05,000000 --> 0:48:05,990000
let them stand in front of me and say, ah, this is not true.

851
0:48:09,000000 --> 0:48:09,990000
Then let's see what kind of payment, what is the puppet, the one that is paid to spit on the websites,

852
0:48:16,000000 --> 0:48:16,990000
to spit on Facebook, people who want to tell the truth as it is.

853
0:48:21,000000 --> 0:48:21,990000
This is what these people form, such people, the dead prostitutes, form a society of people who will not stop for everything that has happened in Bulgaria and has happened in the last 24 years and beyond.

854
0:48:33,000000 --> 0:48:33,990000
What did I say about the DPS that was cut off? I will tell you the truth on the spot. They do this because of the Bulgarian Khomeini. Why?

855
0:48:46,000000 --> 0:48:46,990000
Because they live in absolutely feudal communities.

856
0:48:51,000000 --> 0:48:51,990000
In every settlement, from where they are raised, they are extremely

857
0:48:56,000000 --> 0:48:56,990000
inhabited by the Bulgarian Khomeini.

858
0:48:59,000000 --> 0:48:59,990000
Down, in the village, in the town, in the municipality, where the main The main population of Bulgaria is the dictatorship under the DPS cap.

859
0:49:09,000000 --> 0:49:09,990000
Yes, the last 4 years have been a perfect meeting.

860
0:49:13,000000 --> 0:49:13,990000
The dictator is Boyko Borusov.

861
0:49:15,000000 --> 0:49:15,990000
But let us not forget that Ahmed Ogan is not a smaller dictator than Boyko Borusov.

862
0:49:23,000000 --> 0:49:23,990000
On the contrary, he is more cruel, more cunning, more cunning.

863
0:49:31,000000 --> 0:49:31,990000
While Boyko Borusov is the typical representative of the Baigyan society, here we have a very cunning opponent.

864
0:49:39,000000 --> 0:49:39,990000
And I say exactly the same thing there. DPS, I turn to the Bulgarian Bulgarian leaders.

865
0:49:44,000000 --> 0:49:44,990000
I say this, DPS, turn to the Bulgarian Bulgarian leaders, get out of your fields and stop living in field offices.

866
0:49:49,000000 --> 0:49:49,990000
This was the first thing.

867
0:49:51,000000 --> 0:49:51,990000
The second thing that was wrong was GERD.

868
0:49:54,000000 --> 0:49:54,990000
These many confessions occurred when GERD wanted to open offices in neighboring Turkey to the political parties.

869
0:50:01,000000 --> 0:50:01,990000
Why? Because they wanted to use an electorate, the Bulgarian-Munanites, who are Bulgarian villagers, to vote for the Egyptian political party.

870
0:50:11,000000 --> 0:50:11,990000
They wanted to betray them, as if they didn't know what was happening in Bulgaria. I have sent my publications to the Egyptian Public Party to make an official visit to Turkey.

871
0:50:27,000000 --> 0:50:27,990000
I did it. Why? Because you can't accept a decoration of a general assembly.

872
0:50:33,000000 --> 0:50:33,990000
Because the form of the ethnic-political union is a positive percentage.

873
0:50:37,000000 --> 0:50:37,990000
And at the same time you keep the bombings from the local agency of the Miteci.

874
0:50:40,000000 --> 0:50:40,990000
Who is in charge of a very large income in the treasury of money, if the head of the agency is a thief.

875
0:50:48,000000 --> 0:50:48,990000
The website of the republic publicizes my statement and I continue to confirm it.

876
0:50:54,000000 --> 0:50:54,990000
He has stolen a part in the events downstairs with me.

877
0:50:58,000000 --> 0:50:58,990000
You can't even be the head of the agency and steal a part.

878
0:51:01,000000 --> 0:51:01,990000
Boiko Borisov cannot in the case of Boiko say that he is involved in the theft process.

879
0:51:07,000000 --> 0:51:07,990000
And you go to the attorney and say that Agos Vujic is for me. And there is no way. There is no way.

880
0:51:13,000000 --> 0:51:13,990000
We were asked questions from the director of the show, Karbovski.

881
0:51:16,000000 --> 0:51:16,990000
What is her opinion on the situation in Bulgaria at the moment and this Ksenopavlovskaya and Chumenist's wave also close to the city.

882
0:51:23,000000 --> 0:51:23,990000
I will tell you one thing.

883
0:51:27,000000 --> 0:51:27,990000
I live in Cyprus.

884
0:51:30,000000 --> 0:51:30,990000
This country is the immigration zone.

885
0:51:33,000000 --> 0:51:33,990000
Here live the most diverse ethnic groups, religions and religions.

886
0:51:38,000000 --> 0:51:38,990000
There is the occupation line.

887
0:51:42,000000 --> 0:51:42,990000
There, where the two nations were divided in 1974-1976,

888
0:51:47,000000 --> 0:51:47,990000
they could not live together.

889
0:51:50,000000 --> 0:51:50,990000
On the other side are the Cypriot Turks and on the other side the Cypriot Greeks.

890
0:51:55,000000 --> 0:51:55,990000
Look what has led to this.

891
0:51:59,000000 --> 0:51:59,990000
To the division.

892
0:52:01,000000 --> 0:52:01,990000
A new ruler divided of two parts.

893
0:52:05,000000 --> 0:52:05,990000
Occupation of foreign territory, of a foreign country.

894
0:52:08,000000 --> 0:52:08,990000
This is absolutely illegal.

895
0:52:10,000000 --> 0:52:10,990000
This is Turkey.

896
0:52:12,000000 --> 0:52:12,990000
This is what we want with Bulgaria.

897
0:52:15,000000 --> 0:52:15,990000
I will tell you, when the rulers in Bulgaria, they are international rulers,

898
0:52:21,000000 --> 0:52:21,990000
want to avoid the essential problems for the solution of solve the problems of the Bulgarian nation.

899
0:52:27,000000 --> 0:52:27,990000
Our remaining as a nation is always conflict and problems.

900
0:52:32,000000 --> 0:52:32,990000
If it wasn't for the Bulgarian soldiers who stole, robbed, and kept them alive, now they would be homeless.

901
0:52:40,000000 --> 0:52:40,990000
They are not in fashion, they are rebels. Just like the Mishronti and Kokovozi, the masonry.

902
0:52:46,000000 --> 0:52:46,990000
Terrorists, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda,

903
0:52:49,000000 --> 0:52:49,990000
Al-Qaeda is dead, Syria is facing Bashar.

904
0:52:53,000000 --> 0:52:53,990000
Al-Qaeda is no longer a terrorist organization.

905
0:52:56,000000 --> 0:52:56,990000
Now I will tell you what will be the next war.

906
0:52:59,000000 --> 0:52:59,990000
From above.

907
0:53:01,000000 --> 0:53:01,990000
Infancy.

908
0:53:03,000000 --> 0:53:03,990000
Foreigners will attack us and try to enslave us.

909
0:53:06,000000 --> 0:53:06,990000
Because no one will accept the lies that Al-Qaeda is a terrorist organization.

910
0:53:12,000000 --> 0:53:12,990000
It is not a terrorist organization that is responsible for their own actions.

911
0:53:15,000000 --> 0:53:15,990000
Then the Bulgarians will start.

912
0:53:17,000000 --> 0:53:17,990000
The xenophobic wave, xenophobia, the Syrians without women, Syrians without women...

913
0:53:23,000000 --> 0:53:23,990000
And all the Bulgar in Bulgaria, the whole national energy,

914
0:53:28,000000 --> 0:53:28,990000
is directed towards the refugees in Bulgaria.

915
0:53:31,000000 --> 0:53:31,990000
Why? There are no refugees.

916
0:53:33,000000 --> 0:53:33,990000
The average of the land salaries, the labor of the land,

917
0:53:36,000000 --> 0:53:36,990000
the low salary of the Bulgarians.

918
0:53:39,000000 --> 0:53:39,990000
The fact that we don't have 5, 10, 20, to make a video, we are not in the same boat.

919
0:53:49,000000 --> 0:53:49,990000
The fact that Boyko Borisov, Oglu, together with Erdogan,

920
0:53:56,000000 --> 0:53:56,990000
they have been killing thousands of Syrians, Algerians, Moroccans, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans,

921
0:54:00,000000 --> 0:54:00,990000
there is nothing else. I have been to Turkey, I will tell you.

922
0:54:03,000000 --> 0:54:03,990000
Turkey is a police state, it is not a dictatorship.

923
0:54:10,000000 --> 0:54:10,990000
If someone thinks that he can create such a huge flow and the grinch in your country feels that he is wrong, then he should be deeply wrong. This was the intention of everything to be done so that the first responders can leave, so they can ask for leave, and so on.

924
0:54:16,000000 --> 0:54:16,990000
But in this way, one thing is not investigated.

925
0:54:19,000000 --> 0:54:19,990000
Corruption, which has the size of a storm. Yesterday I was at the Elkhata, I was on the bus, I saw a video with a friend.

926
0:54:32,000000 --> 0:54:32,990000
Why? He says something very interesting.

927
0:54:36,000000 --> 0:54:36,990000
Corruption, stop sharing, love each other, good, good, good.

928
0:54:40,000000 --> 0:54:40,990000
Why? This was not reflected in the media.

929
0:54:42,000000 --> 0:54:42,990000
Regardless of what they represent, a movement that I am not a member of.

930
0:54:45,000000 --> 0:54:45,990000
But he is telling the truth.

931
0:54:48,000000 --> 0:54:48,990000
Dear friends,

932
0:54:51,000000 --> 0:54:51,990000
at the moment we are playing a scenario

933
0:54:55,000000 --> 0:54:55,990000
whose speakers are those who organized in 1917

934
0:55:02,000000 --> 0:55:02,990000
the revolution in Kudosia,

935
0:55:09,000000 --> 0:55:09,990000
and later those who directed the Russian revolution. They are the same.

936
0:55:12,000000 --> 0:55:12,990000
You cry on both sides.

937
0:55:14,000000 --> 0:55:14,990000
Read Nikolov's books to understand the truth.

938
0:55:21,000000 --> 0:55:21,990000
And by the way, because of these days he was killed.

939
0:55:25,000000 --> 0:55:25,990000
Thank you for listening.
