84
0:02:27,000000 --> 0:02:27,990000
My life was such that, like most people, I didn't do what I wanted.

85
0:02:35,000000 --> 0:02:35,990000
And that in itself is a great misfortune.

86
0:02:41,000000 --> 0:02:41,990000
But things didn't always look like this.

87
0:02:45,000000 --> 0:02:45,990000
Do we know how we look in the eyes of others?

88
0:02:52,000000 --> 0:02:52,990000
And how we look in our own eyes?

89
0:02:56,000000 --> 0:02:56,990000
Honestly, I'm not sure that today's situation, how I live now, after a while, will not be more oppressive than it was years ago.

90
0:03:12,000000 --> 0:03:12,990000
The opportunities and freedom in our world are hard to bear

91
0:03:17,000000 --> 0:03:17,990000
to trust them with a light hand and heart.

92
0:03:22,000000 --> 0:03:22,990000
I was a little bit worried.

93
0:03:32,000000 --> 0:03:32,990000
But let's move on to the question.

94
0:03:38,000000 --> 0:03:38,990000
Now I found some peace and sat down to write you an answer.

95
0:03:43,000000 --> 0:03:43,990000
I've thought about it for many monotonous days.

96
0:03:51,000000 --> 0:03:51,990000
I've written letters. I did it in those years, I'm not so sure about anything anymore.

97
0:04:12,000000 --> 0:04:12,990000
How strange it really is.

98
0:04:16,000000 --> 0:04:16,990000
How the youth is filled with the clarity of the solution,

99
0:04:20,000000 --> 0:04:20,990000
categorical in the way itness, the stubbornness.

100
0:04:26,000000 --> 0:04:26,990000
After time, everything changes.

101
0:04:31,000000 --> 0:04:31,990000
After that, we become more and more insecure.

102
0:04:35,000000 --> 0:04:35,990000
In ourselves and in the world.

103
0:04:40,000000 --> 0:04:40,990000
Somehow we manage to understand that.

104
0:04:43,000000 --> 0:04:43,990000
We're still trying to figure it out.

105
0:04:50,000000 --> 0:04:50,990000
I got my address.

106
0:04:54,000000 --> 0:04:54,990000
Years later I got it by accident.

107
0:04:57,000000 --> 0:04:57,990000
By accident.

108
0:05:01,000000 --> 0:05:01,990000
You know, now everyone contacts me via the Internet.

109
0:05:06,000000 --> 0:05:06,990000
And the mailboxes are filled with advertisements and notes.

110
0:05:12,000000 --> 0:05:12,990000
That's why I was so surprised when I found your letter in your box.

111
0:05:20,000000 --> 0:05:20,990000
I could have found it easily.

112
0:05:26,000000 --> 0:05:26,990000
The same one, the one with the box at the entrance, which you remember. A while ago I was in Odessa in Deleno, just to find a frog with its broken key and almost hanging on a panty-bag.

113
0:05:36,000000 --> 0:05:36,990000
A box in which the children often leave a frightened frog or packages of waffles and croissants on them, for which they don't care.

114
0:05:47,000000 --> 0:05:47,990000
I'm just a little afraid they leave something more disgusting.

115
0:05:52,000000 --> 0:05:52,990000
That's how it is when you're alone and defenseless like me.

116
0:05:59,000000 --> 0:05:59,990000
Every time I check it, I first blow the end of my cane under my brother's.

117
0:06:05,000000 --> 0:06:05,990000
And then I take out whatever is there.

118
0:06:08,000000 --> 0:06:08,990000
I look at the corner of the column and I put in one.

119
0:06:12,000000 --> 0:06:12,990000
Carton, a pocket, the unnecessary.

120
0:06:18,000000 --> 0:06:18,990000
I understood everything that the cleaner at the entrance will throw out later in the bucket for the book.

121
0:06:23,000000 --> 0:06:23,990000
Yes, imagine, we have a cleaner. The entrance cleaners were thrown into the bin for the The town was destroyed by the bombings during the war and then rebuilt in the difficult years after it.

122
0:06:51,000000 --> 0:06:51,990000
Dear friend,

123
0:06:58,000000 --> 0:06:58,990000
you know how hard it was for my parents to live through all this horror.

124
0:07:06,000000 --> 0:07:06,990000
Do you know how hard it was for my parents to live through all this horror? So that they don't get hurt, even though

125
0:07:10,000000 --> 0:07:10,990000
today, due to the worst of the earthquake, we can all end up in the ruins of the house.

126
0:07:17,000000 --> 0:07:17,990000
But aren't we all, too, under our own ruins, erased from the impossibility to live normally,

127
0:07:26,000000 --> 0:07:26,990000
from our past,

128
0:07:29,000000 --> 0:07:29,990000
from the uncertainty that awaits us.

129
0:07:32,000000 --> 0:07:32,990000
In all cases, we are even more hopeless.

130
0:07:41,000000 --> 0:07:41,990000
Just that I am crying for you,

131
0:07:43,000000 --> 0:07:43,990000
at a stage that you must have lived so much, is of no use.

132
0:07:49,000000 --> 0:07:49,990000
Your life must have been very difficult, too. And you had difficulties.

133
0:07:55,000000 --> 0:07:55,990000
And that's why I realized before this letter, which I barely found in an old teacher's notebook, I threw it away, who knows why, at home.

134
0:08:06,000000 --> 0:08:06,990000
I found a few more.

135
0:08:09,000000 --> 0:08:09,990000
My last pages were written out and I threw them away,

136
0:08:12,000000 --> 0:08:12,990000
so I use them for something.

137
0:08:15,000000 --> 0:08:15,990000
I save them in recipes.

138
0:08:18,000000 --> 0:08:18,990000
I often record them from the TV culinary show,

139
0:08:21,000000 --> 0:08:21,990000
which I watch every day.

140
0:08:24,000000 --> 0:08:24,990000
But I've never tried to taste what would happen if I said I would cook something like that.

141
0:08:30,000000 --> 0:08:30,990000
Honestly, I prefer to make my own dishes, as my grandson tells them.

142
0:08:36,000000 --> 0:08:36,990000
I remember them from my grandmother and my mother.

143
0:08:40,000000 --> 0:08:40,990000
I have very few recipes. Tradition is important in a dish.

144
0:08:46,000000 --> 0:08:46,990000
Then it keeps the taste and the skills of the generation before you.

145
0:08:50,000000 --> 0:08:50,990000
Something that is difficult.

146
0:08:53,000000 --> 0:08:53,990000
It is very difficult to change it for something better.

147
0:08:56,000000 --> 0:08:56,990000
For something tastier.

148
0:08:59,000000 --> 0:08:59,990000
I will never forget.

149
0:09:04,000000 --> 0:09:04,990000
Ah, the cuckoo that was cooking for me.

150
0:09:09,000000 --> 0:09:09,990000
My mother always wanted to be better and she added spices that changed the taste.

151
0:09:17,000000 --> 0:09:17,990000
How nice it is to taste something familiar, loved,

152
0:09:23,000000 --> 0:09:23,990000
which reminds you of home, of the warmth of the family.

153
0:09:30,000000 --> 0:09:30,990000
It's so rare.

154
0:09:33,000000 --> 0:09:33,990000
I mean the warmth.

155
0:09:38,000000 --> 0:09:38,990000
I've almost made the whole taffeta from broken leaves, written with new recipes.

156
0:09:44,000000 --> 0:09:44,990000
Maybe someone will decide to try them.

157
0:09:48,000000 --> 0:09:48,990000
That's why every day, exactly at 9.30 in the morning, I sit in front of the TV.

158
0:09:53,000000 --> 0:09:53,990000
And without that, I have done my little homework, which I have as a wife.

159
0:09:59,000000 --> 0:09:59,990000
I always watched you do your homework in the morning, my mother said,

160
0:10:03,000000 --> 0:10:03,990000
so that you have days for something else.

161
0:10:06,000000 --> 0:10:06,990000
There was a more meaningful plan from home,

162
0:10:09,000000 --> 0:10:09,990000
which is exhausting and overwhelming,

163
0:10:14,000000 --> 0:10:14,990000
but it has to be done. There is no way.

164
0:10:17,000000 --> 0:10:17,990000
Now, when my years have passed,

165
0:10:20,000000 --> 0:10:20,990000
there is no one to clean, to cook.

166
0:10:24,000000 --> 0:10:24,990000
I hate this cooking. I have no one to clean, to cook for.

167
0:10:28,000000 --> 0:10:28,990000
I hate cooking.

168
0:10:32,000000 --> 0:10:32,990000
It takes so long to lose.

169
0:10:35,000000 --> 0:10:35,990000
And the flour... I worked hard today, tomorrow will be the same.

170
0:10:39,000000 --> 0:10:39,990000
I'm a girl, I rarely come for someone,

171
0:10:41,000000 --> 0:10:41,990000
and then I ask myself, and so on.

172
0:10:45,000000 --> 0:10:45,990000
If I have to think... I rarely came across anyone and I was asked again. And so on.

173
0:10:49,000000 --> 0:10:49,990000
If I may say so myself,

174
0:10:53,000000 --> 0:10:53,990000
how many hours of my life have I spent rushing, cooking, washing my clothes,

175
0:11:01,000000 --> 0:11:01,990000
starving, shopping,

176
0:11:04,000000 --> 0:11:04,990000
the stupid things of life.

177
0:11:07,000000 --> 0:11:07,990000
But I've fallen back again.

178
0:11:13,000000 --> 0:11:13,990000
When we can't express our pain, we talk about such things.

179
0:11:17,000000 --> 0:11:17,990000
For life it's pointless.

180
0:11:22,000000 --> 0:11:22,990000
For pain it's a dominion. The pain is gone.

181
0:11:45,000000 --> 0:11:45,990000
My table, my friend, is right in front of the TV. The big one.

182
0:11:47,000000 --> 0:11:47,990000
The one you love.

183
0:11:49,000000 --> 0:11:49,990000
The one you remember for sure.

184
0:11:52,000000 --> 0:11:52,990000
But his seat was too short.

185
0:11:55,000000 --> 0:11:55,990000
The blanket and the material were too thin.

186
0:11:58,000000 --> 0:11:58,990000
A neighbour with a good heart

187
0:12:02,000000 --> 0:12:02,990000
had to cut.

188
0:12:05,000000 --> 0:12:05,990000
By measure I cut a piece of cloth

189
0:12:08,000000 --> 0:12:08,990000
and to sew it.

190
0:12:10,000000 --> 0:12:10,990000
And I dried a head,

191
0:12:12,000000 --> 0:12:12,990000
which I filled with old pieces and churro-pugashnits.

192
0:12:15,000000 --> 0:12:15,990000
So now I can sit for a long time

193
0:12:19,000000 --> 0:12:19,990000
and feel comfortable while I watch the program.

194
0:12:25,600000 --> 0:12:28
As I understood, I started at 9.30.

195
0:12:28,700000 --> 0:12:32,500000
I was writing down the recipe and I put it in a nylon envelope.

196
0:12:33,300000 --> 0:12:35,600000
After that, I watched only two episodes.

197
0:12:36,100000 --> 0:12:39,400000
One in the morning, after which I had lunch,

198
0:12:39,800000 --> 0:12:41,200000
and the other one at 6.00.

199
0:12:41,600000 --> 0:12:48
When the day had passed, it's time to take your seat again.

200
0:12:49,000000 --> 0:12:49,990000
If you wonder if I'm not cold, because I've been sitting for so long, I'll tell you the truth – no.

201
0:12:58,000000 --> 0:12:58,990000
I have a beautiful shawl, which I've been weaving for a few years now.

202
0:13:03,000000 --> 0:13:03,990000
The thread is pure wool, Icelandic. My grandson gave it for a few're here. The room is so warm and warm,

203
0:13:25,000000 --> 0:13:25,990000
with beautiful squares.

204
0:13:27,000000 --> 0:13:27,990000
Sometimes, when I have time,

205
0:13:29,000000 --> 0:13:29,990000
he comes to see me.

206
0:13:31,000000 --> 0:13:31,990000
Of course, not very often.

207
0:13:33,000000 --> 0:13:33,990000
You know, these days

208
0:13:35,000000 --> 0:13:35,990000
other children are faster,

209
0:13:37,000000 --> 0:13:37,990000
but there is still time for guests and visits.

210
0:13:40,000000 --> 0:13:40,990000
What else will he learn from me?

211
0:13:44,000000 --> 0:13:44,990000
I can only feed him with chocolate, which he keeps in case.

212
0:13:49,000000 --> 0:13:49,990000
Sometimes I eat two pieces of it, while I watch the news in the evening.

213
0:13:55,000000 --> 0:13:55,990000
For relaxation and for the salad.

214
0:13:58,000000 --> 0:13:58,990000
To tell you more, I love movies.

215
0:14:01,000000 --> 0:14:01,990000
The news is straining me, it scares me.

216
0:14:04,000000 --> 0:14:04,990000
The news are straining me, they scare me. And I keep thinking how I will spend a month until retirement,

217
0:14:08,000000 --> 0:14:08,990000
where is my grandson, have they picked him up alive and well,

218
0:14:11,000000 --> 0:14:11,990000
if any thief will ring the doorbell,

219
0:14:13,000000 --> 0:14:13,990000
I will open it and see what happens.

220
0:14:17,000000 --> 0:14:17,990000
Or a fraudster will call me on the phone and tell me something,

221
0:14:22,000000 --> 0:14:22,990000
and then he would fix it.

222
0:14:28,000000 --> 0:14:28,990000
I'm not young anymore.

223
0:14:31,000000 --> 0:14:31,990000
My hair has almost fallen off.

224
0:14:36,000000 --> 0:14:36,990000
I'm going to get my hair done tomorrow.

225
0:14:40,000000 --> 0:14:40,990000
I've found my own way.

226
0:14:45,000000 --> 0:14:45,990000
I'm not the woman you remember.

227
0:14:52,000000 --> 0:14:52,990000
My hands are bruised, my veins are swollen.

228
0:14:57,000000 --> 0:14:57,990000
I'm tired, I want this and that to be over.

229
0:15:02,000000 --> 0:15:02,990000
Time is running out and My knees are spinning.

230
0:15:06,000000 --> 0:15:06,990000
I barely move.

231
0:15:08,000000 --> 0:15:08,990000
It's good that it's a cane.

232
0:15:10,000000 --> 0:15:10,990000
I don't like it. I hate it.

233
0:15:12,000000 --> 0:15:12,990000
I made it, but it's my only and most sure resistance.

234
0:15:18,000000 --> 0:15:18,990000
If you see me somewhere now,

235
0:15:21,000000 --> 0:15:21,990000
as I'm sitting and writing,

236
0:15:24,000000 --> 0:15:24,990000
will you recognize me?

237
0:15:28,000000 --> 0:15:28,990000
Surely not.

238
0:15:36,000000 --> 0:15:36,990000
Life gives you whispers in your youth, and then you take it.

239
0:15:42,000000 --> 0:15:42,990000
I have to take it.

240
0:15:49,000000 --> 0:15:49,990000
The politics they talk about on TV, and the sports, I'm afraid that a lot of sports give,

241
0:15:51,000000 --> 0:15:51,990000
I'm not interested in that.

242
0:15:53,000000 --> 0:15:53,990000
That's why I watch movies.

243
0:15:55,000000 --> 0:15:55,990000
The same is with culinary shows on all channels.

244
0:15:59,000000 --> 0:15:59,990000
My grandson decided to pay me every month

245
0:16:02,000000 --> 0:16:02,990000
my cable fee on TV.

246
0:16:04,000000 --> 0:16:04,990000
And so I got myself many channels,

247
0:16:08,480000 --> 0:16:11,320000
three or four of them at most.

248
0:16:12,040000 --> 0:16:16,400000
Even the sitting in a comfortable chair and the endless curiosity

249
0:16:16,480000 --> 0:16:20,240000
help me when I'm sick to watch whatever it is.

250
0:16:20,320000 --> 0:16:23,640000
I've written so many recipes that this life won't be enough

251
0:16:23,720000 --> 0:16:26
to be fulfilled and fulfilled.

252
0:16:26,000000 --> 0:16:26,990000
And let's not talk about the movies.

253
0:16:28,000000 --> 0:16:28,990000
Until one time I was wondering who plays the main role.

254
0:16:35,000000 --> 0:16:35,990000
As well as some second graders who have impressed me.

255
0:16:40,000000 --> 0:16:40,990000
Who is the director and since which year is the film?

256
0:16:44,000000 --> 0:16:44,990000
After that I die.

257
0:16:47,000000 --> 0:16:47,990000
Now I sit and watch only.

258
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
Serials, movies, some shows, programs,

259
0:16:53,000000 --> 0:16:53,990000
as much as I can, and I turn off the TV remotely.

260
0:16:56,000000 --> 0:16:56,990000
Very comfortable.

261
0:16:57,000000 --> 0:16:57,990000
A slap and that's it.

262
0:17:02,000000 --> 0:17:02,990000
After that I sit down. Then I leave the chair on the table or on the table, depending on the weather.

263
0:17:15,000000 --> 0:17:15,990000
I laugh.

264
0:17:18,000000 --> 0:17:18,990000
My left hand is twisted and I just look at the dark screen in which this whole picture is reflected.

265
0:17:33,000000 --> 0:17:33,990000
As if I was watching.

266
0:17:38,000000 --> 0:17:38,990000
I am sitting in the TV.

267
0:17:41,000000 --> 0:17:41,990000
I can even imagine how some movie ends.

268
0:17:45,000000 --> 0:17:45,990000
I've slept through the end or the phone is off.

269
0:17:49,000000 --> 0:17:49,990000
The neighbor came to ask if there was warm water or it was cold.

270
0:17:55,000000 --> 0:17:55,990000
Just to get in and sit down a little.

271
0:17:58,000000 --> 0:17:58,990000
Then I think about the hero. All good things.

272
0:18:03,000000 --> 0:18:03,990000
The victims are whether they were killed or recovered,

273
0:18:07,000000 --> 0:18:07,990000
saved by a miracle and so on.

274
0:18:11,000000 --> 0:18:11,990000
It goes on like this. Sometimes I say to myself,

275
0:18:14,000000 --> 0:18:14,990000
that's why I stop the TV and stand in the middle.

276
0:18:17,000000 --> 0:18:17,990000
The important thing is in the head of a person.

277
0:18:20,000000 --> 0:18:20,990000
What is it? What do I think?

278
0:18:25,000000 --> 0:18:25,990000
Do I think? What is it? What are they thinking? Are they thinking?

279
0:18:31,000000 --> 0:18:31,990000
I have almost no one.

280
0:18:37,000000 --> 0:18:37,990000
That's why I got so angry when I received the letter.

281
0:18:41,000000 --> 0:18:41,990000
And then someone wrote to me. He remembered me.

282
0:18:47,000000 --> 0:18:47,990000
I didn't think he could be here.

283
0:18:50,000000 --> 0:18:50,990000
I didn't expect it. I was desperate, I was used to it.

284
0:18:53,000000 --> 0:18:53,990000
You know, actually, there's no way you know.

285
0:18:56,000000 --> 0:18:56,990000
I've been putting it down for so many years and I can't see what's written.

286
0:19:00,000000 --> 0:19:00,990000
Without them, I took the letter from the box,

287
0:19:03,000000 --> 0:19:03,990000
as I opened the door carefully, and and then I grabbed it with my hand.

288
0:19:08,000000 --> 0:19:08,990000
I was burning with impatience to understand the name and

289
0:19:12,000000 --> 0:19:12,990000
I tried to read it in the dark, but I was in my bag.

290
0:19:17,000000 --> 0:19:17,990000
I don't carry it with me when I go to the market,

291
0:19:21,000000 --> 0:19:21,990000
so that no one will steal it from me.

292
0:19:24,000000 --> 0:19:24,990000
Times are so terrible that even in the middle of the day

293
0:19:26,000000 --> 0:19:26,990000
I can steal your bag. But it's only on Sundays.

294
0:19:30,000000 --> 0:19:30,990000
When I go to the nearby church to hear the service

295
0:19:35,000000 --> 0:19:35,990000
or if I'm invited to a party,

296
0:19:38,000000 --> 0:19:38,990000
some of my little friends have stayed to visit me

297
0:19:42,000000 --> 0:19:42,990000
for the afternoon tea or just to go for a walk, if the time allowed.

298
0:19:51,000000 --> 0:19:51,990000
I carefully puked with one hand the letter in the pocket of my vest,

299
0:19:56,000000 --> 0:19:56,990000
with the other hand I healthy squeezed the bag with the products and with both hands,

300
0:20:02,000000 --> 0:20:02,990000
the last ones maybe for this autumn, which happened warm and long,

301
0:20:06,000000 --> 0:20:06,990000
full of vegetables and fruits on the market.

302
0:20:11,000000 --> 0:20:11,990000
Then I went inside.

303
0:20:14,000000 --> 0:20:14,990000
The closing of the entrance door became almost a ritual.

304
0:20:19,000000 --> 0:20:19,990000
I wrapped the key twice.

305
0:20:22,000000 --> 0:20:22,990000
I checked in case the door was really locked and the boots broke.

306
0:20:31,000000 --> 0:20:31,990000
It didn't take long for me to realize that the cross would hurt me if I had to stand for a long time and untie it.

307
0:20:42,000000 --> 0:20:42,990000
and to untie it. That's why I left the bag on top of the shoe closet

308
0:20:48,000000 --> 0:20:48,990000
and then I carefully took off my hat.

309
0:20:52,000000 --> 0:20:52,990000
There are no more hats.

310
0:20:54,000000 --> 0:20:54,990000
There is no more shop where they can just

311
0:20:57,000000 --> 0:20:57,990000
clean your felt hat.

312
0:21:00,000000 --> 0:21:00,990000
That's why I was very careful.

313
0:21:03,000000 --> 0:21:03,990000
I sat at the table in the lobby

314
0:21:06,600000 --> 0:21:09,640000
and even then I took off my boots,

315
0:21:10,280000 --> 0:21:11,960000
put on my shoes

316
0:21:12,640000 --> 0:21:15,720000
and I did it gradually, not suddenly,

317
0:21:16,320000 --> 0:21:19,520000
but carefully, as the doctor told me.

318
0:21:24,000000 --> 0:21:24,990000
The letter was lying in my pocket all the time. But until I got up and sat down to open it, I was afraid who could write to me.

319
0:21:29,000000 --> 0:21:29,990000
Most likely I said to myself, since there really is no one to sit down and write a letter to me,

320
0:21:34,000000 --> 0:21:34,990000
this is me, some bill for unpaid water, I'm in debt.

321
0:21:39,000000 --> 0:21:39,990000
Because I call and pay so much attention to the phone,

322
0:21:43,000000 --> 0:21:43,990000
I don't know how much I water, I'm for steam.

323
0:21:47,000000 --> 0:21:47,990000
Because I pay so much attention to the phone, so they don't stop.

324
0:21:51,000000 --> 0:21:51,990000
I'm saving, for example, this month the water, the other the steam.

325
0:21:56,000000 --> 0:21:56,990000
Small tricks. So things are regulated.

326
0:22:01,000000 --> 0:22:01,990000
When summer comes, I manage to pay everything by autumn.

327
0:22:06,000000 --> 0:22:06,990000
I tried to remember if I had already paid all the bills, and I couldn't.

328
0:22:12,000000 --> 0:22:12,990000
I took out the last one from the bag, put it down and read your name on the cover. THE END

329
0:22:42,000000 --> 0:22:42,990000
If I admit, dear friend, that I cried, you will not be surprised. I hope you remember everything I have experienced towards you,

330
0:22:47,000000 --> 0:22:47,990000
and which I have probably reinforced since I left.

331
0:22:50,000000 --> 0:22:50,990000
I had no idea what had happened to you, how you were living.

332
0:22:58,000000 --> 0:22:58,990000
Years passed by.

333
0:23:02,000000 --> 0:23:02,990000
Instead of weakening, my pains grew bigger.

334
0:23:06,000000 --> 0:23:06,990000
Even if I got stuck in the life I was living, it didn't stop.

335
0:23:10,000000 --> 0:23:10,990000
Sometimes I still feel it today.

336
0:23:17,000000 --> 0:23:17,990000
At a certain point I imagined

337
0:23:20,000000 --> 0:23:20,990000
you come back, you call me on the phone

338
0:23:24,000000 --> 0:23:24,990000
and while I was sitting by him and listening on the phone and I, while I'm sitting by the door,

339
0:23:26,000000 --> 0:23:26,990000
I pick up the phone and I pass by.

340
0:23:32,000000 --> 0:23:32,990000
Or you come home while I'm just walking around with a friend

341
0:23:37,000000 --> 0:23:37,990000
and I don't care about anything.

342
0:23:39,000000 --> 0:23:39,990000
You don't find me, the plane takes off after a few hours,

343
0:23:43,000000 --> 0:23:43,990000
I get up and I read a note on the door handle

344
0:23:47,000000 --> 0:23:47,990000
that I had come and I had crashed.

345
0:23:54,000000 --> 0:23:54,990000
I imagined such things.

346
0:23:56,000000 --> 0:23:56,990000
And it was very painful.

347
0:24:02,000000 --> 0:24:02,990000
I suffered.

348
0:24:06,000000 --> 0:24:06,990000
Which one hurts more?

349
0:24:09,000000 --> 0:24:09,990000
The fantasies?

350
0:24:13,000000 --> 0:24:13,990000
Or the reality?

351
0:24:17,000000 --> 0:24:17,990000
Tell me. The The The The The

352
0:24:25,320000 --> 0:24:26,320000
The

353
0:24:26,320000 --> 0:24:27,320000
The

354
0:24:27,320000 --> 0:24:28,320000
The

355
0:24:28,320000 --> 0:24:29,320000
The

356
0:24:29,320000 --> 0:24:30,320000
The

357
0:24:30,320000 --> 0:24:31,320000
The

358
0:24:31,320000 --> 0:24:32,320000
The

359
0:24:32,320000 --> 0:24:33,320000
The

360
0:24:33,320000 --> 0:24:34,320000
The

361
0:24:34,320000 --> 0:24:35,320000
The

362
0:24:35,320000 --> 0:24:36,320000
The

363
0:24:36,320000 --> 0:24:37,320000
The

364
0:24:37,320000 --> 0:24:38,320000
The

365
0:24:38,320000 --> 0:24:39,320000
The

366
0:24:39,320000 --> 0:24:40,320000
The

367
0:24:40,320000 --> 0:24:41,320000
The

368
0:24:41,320000 --> 0:24:42,320000
The

369
0:24:42,320000 --> 0:24:45
If you ask me to tell you about my life until today,

370
0:24:45,000000 --> 0:24:45,990000
I hope it will be better.

371
0:24:48,000000 --> 0:24:48,990000
Because I will cause pain to myself and to you.

372
0:24:53,000000 --> 0:24:53,990000
And today this makes no sense.

373
0:24:58,000000 --> 0:24:58,990000
Soon you will pass away.

374
0:25:01,000000 --> 0:25:01,990000
And everything will flow according to the script.

375
0:25:06,000000 --> 0:25:06,990000
I got married happily.

376
0:25:09,000000 --> 0:25:09,990000
I gave birth to a daughter, whom I named after my mother.

377
0:25:13,000000 --> 0:25:13,990000
And she did the same on her side.

378
0:25:17,000000 --> 0:25:17,990000
And now I have a wonderful grandson. A student.

379
0:25:21,000000 --> 0:25:21,990000
I hope he will succeed in life. Maybe in his future work, which seems more normal to me, he will.

380
0:25:29,000000 --> 0:25:29,990000
Life and success were two separate rules, which at least in my case

381
0:25:35,000000 --> 0:25:35,990000
never met, did not make them meet.

382
0:25:40,000000 --> 0:25:40,990000
That's why today I'm going to ask you something for him.

383
0:25:44,000000 --> 0:25:44,990000
That's why I've been writing you letters for so long.

384
0:25:49,000000 --> 0:25:49,990000
It's a short letter, but it's so nice.

385
0:25:54,000000 --> 0:25:54,990000
I understand that you're really happy in Turkey.

386
0:25:59,000000 --> 0:25:59,990000
I'm surprised that you haven't been back here for so many years.

387
0:26:03,000000 --> 0:26:03,990000
Because those who have been back for a long time are not persecuted.

388
0:26:07,200000 --> 0:26:13,200000
And things are very different from when I escaped you.

389
0:26:13,200000 --> 0:26:16,200000
No one can change the names of people anymore.

390
0:26:19,200000 --> 0:26:23,200000
You must have been so offended that you don't want to come back now

391
0:26:23,200000 --> 0:26:27,280000
even once you've to your native place.

392
0:26:29,760000 --> 0:26:31,760000
It must be hard.

393
0:26:33,200000 --> 0:26:39,480000
Yes, to call yourself Zafir and to be forced to become Zafir...

394
0:26:39,600000 --> 0:26:42,360000
It's a game. What else can it be?

395
0:26:43,280000 --> 0:26:45
When your grandmother, your grandfather and your whole family

396
0:26:45,000000 --> 0:26:45,990000
are Turkish names, and I'm still going to be from Angelina to Ayla.

397
0:26:49,000000 --> 0:26:49,990000
I thought to myself, what's your root?

398
0:26:52,000000 --> 0:26:52,990000
Are you a Turk, a Maghbo, a Mohamedan?

399
0:26:55,000000 --> 0:26:55,990000
I just loved you.

400
0:27:02,000000 --> 0:27:02,990000
I then assumed that you didn't mention anything to to keep you from giving them away.

401
0:27:09,000000 --> 0:27:09,990000
Or to keep me from getting in trouble.

402
0:27:18,000000 --> 0:27:18,990000
I understand that it wasn't easy.

403
0:27:20,000000 --> 0:27:20,990000
It was exactly like that. You know, back then I was a young girl,

404
0:27:26,000000 --> 0:27:26,990000
I was watching the events,

405
0:27:29,000000 --> 0:27:29,990000
the renaming.

406
0:27:32,000000 --> 0:27:32,990000
They were only heard by the hearing,

407
0:27:35,000000 --> 0:27:35,990000
it was far from Sofia and they were talking about

408
0:27:38,000000 --> 0:27:38,990000
very contradictory things.

409
0:27:41,000000 --> 0:27:41,990000
No one said that people are renamed by force.

410
0:27:44,000000 --> 0:27:44,990000
Not just the little ones, but the families, the dead.

411
0:27:49,840000 --> 0:27:54,480000
I have no idea what the country is like.

412
0:27:54,600000 --> 0:28:00,160000
People have sacrificed their lives, but they didn't want to change their names.

413
0:28:00,280000 --> 0:28:02
It's a shame.

414
0:28:02,120000 --> 0:28:06
Every government should cover your shameful deeds.

415
0:28:11,000000 --> 0:28:11,990000
Later I understood the truth.

416
0:28:14,000000 --> 0:28:14,990000
I learned what it was like.

417
0:28:18,000000 --> 0:28:18,990000
Somehow I realized that the name carries the fate of a person.

418
0:28:22,000000 --> 0:28:22,990000
That it can't be changed like this because of one or the other government.

419
0:28:28,000000 --> 0:28:28,990000
I thought about your parents in that town,

420
0:28:32,000000 --> 0:28:32,990000
how they lived through all this,

421
0:28:34,000000 --> 0:28:34,990000
how they felt then about the murder,

422
0:28:36,000000 --> 0:28:36,990000
the humiliation and the fear,

423
0:28:38,000000 --> 0:28:38,990000
and about Kapak,

424
0:28:40,000000 --> 0:28:40,990000
you, the irreversible.

425
0:28:44,000000 --> 0:28:44,990000
That's what I told him.

426
0:28:46,000000 --> 0:28:46,990000
Because here in Sofia, things were presented to people in a different way.

427
0:28:50,000000 --> 0:28:50,990000
There were even books on the street that convinced people that they were Bulgarians,

428
0:28:55,000000 --> 0:28:55,990000
and then they were taught and so they would return to their roots.

429
0:28:59,000000 --> 0:28:59,990000
Pure propaganda.

430
0:29:01,000000 --> 0:29:01,990000
The Muslims themselves wanted to call themselves with a Bulgarian name and they were given signs from which to be chosen.

431
0:29:07,000000 --> 0:29:07,990000
If they were party members, secretaries, militiamen, activists,

432
0:29:11,000000 --> 0:29:11,990000
even teachers, they chose their names instead of theirs.

433
0:29:20,000000 --> 0:29:20,990000
I learned that.

434
0:29:23,000000 --> 0:29:23,990000
Ten years later, when the big tour started,

435
0:29:28,000000 --> 0:29:28,990000
it was no longer so serious.

436
0:29:31,000000 --> 0:29:31,990000
After a few years, it was understood that there were also fights and murders.

437
0:29:37,000000 --> 0:29:37,990000
Some were thrown into prison.

438
0:29:40,000000 --> 0:29:40,990000
And they said they were going to celebrate their new names.

439
0:29:49,000000 --> 0:29:49,990000
I remembered that at that time in the cross-border

440
0:29:53,000000 --> 0:29:53,990000
there was a question. Bulgar, Rum, Muhammedanin.

441
0:29:57,000000 --> 0:29:57,990000
The correct answer was POMAK.

442
0:30:03,000000 --> 0:30:03,990000
I also remembered that it was over.

443
0:30:09,000000 --> 0:30:09,990000
I was used to the idea.

444
0:30:14,000000 --> 0:30:14,990000
Then, in Masov, the Turks started to chase me away from here. My neighbours made me go to meetings, to protect my family from the Turks.

445
0:30:18,000000 --> 0:30:18,990000
They said they wanted to take parts of Bulgaria from me.

446
0:30:21,000000 --> 0:30:21,990000
Such things.

447
0:30:23,000000 --> 0:30:23,990000
They spoke in slogans, repeating word by word

448
0:30:26,000000 --> 0:30:26,990000
the news from the TV.

449
0:30:28,000000 --> 0:30:28,990000
I don't love politics,

450
0:30:30,000000 --> 0:30:30,990000
I didn't go to meetings with them.

451
0:30:32,000000 --> 0:30:32,990000
And there was a meeting

452
0:30:34,000000 --> 0:30:34,990000
against the Bulgarian Turks.

453
0:30:36,000000 --> 0:30:36,990000
It was huge.

454
0:30:38,000000 --> 0:30:38,990000
I saw it on the news

455
0:30:40,000000 --> 0:30:40,990000
and my heart was beating.

456
0:30:42,000000 --> 0:30:42,990000
I thought about you,

457
0:30:44,000000 --> 0:30:44,990000
but I kept silent.

458
0:30:50,000000 --> 0:30:50,990000
I watched Ira repeating how I was running away from these things. I was taking long queues of people by car on the way to the border.

459
0:30:54,000000 --> 0:30:54,990000
In my room with luggage, children, old people, scared and worried faces.

460
0:31:01,000000 --> 0:31:01,990000
I had no idea where I was.

461
0:31:04,000000 --> 0:31:04,990000
I disappeared.

462
0:31:05,000000 --> 0:31:05,990000
We were separated forever.

463
0:31:08,000000 --> 0:31:08,990000
I thought my heart wouldn't listen to me,

464
0:31:11,000000 --> 0:31:11,990000
but it doesn't now.

465
0:31:14,000000 --> 0:31:14,990000
I have a lot of arrhythmia.

466
0:31:17,000000 --> 0:31:17,990000
I took medicine.

467
0:31:20,000000 --> 0:31:20,990000
You know, when the names of the people returned,

468
0:31:26,000000 --> 0:31:26,990000
the neighbours also pretended that nothing had happened.

469
0:31:30,000000 --> 0:31:30,990000
That they really didn't remember.

470
0:31:33,000000 --> 0:31:33,990000
But they did.

471
0:31:36,000000 --> 0:31:36,990000
It was painful, but life went on.

472
0:31:41,000000 --> 0:31:41,990000
As you know, feelings have this property to be detached after a while,

473
0:31:48,000000 --> 0:31:48,990000
and the pain to sink in and hide somewhere deep down,

474
0:31:54,000000 --> 0:31:54,990000
until they appear again, unexpectedly, unbearably, as before.

475
0:32:03,000000 --> 0:32:03,990000
You know, we always have a choice, even if not always the best one. I was as I was before.

476
0:32:10,000000 --> 0:32:10,990000
You know, we always have a choice, even if it's not always the best. Maybe you've heard that other things...

477
0:32:14,000000 --> 0:32:14,990000
At first I didn't pay attention and I almost forgot about the missing children.

478
0:32:22,000000 --> 0:32:22,990000
Why did I pass away without telling me? I didn't know then.

479
0:32:26,000000 --> 0:32:26,990000
I thought I would never know until I got this letter.

480
0:32:30,000000 --> 0:32:30,990000
I had doubts. I didn't want to know.

481
0:32:32,000000 --> 0:32:32,990000
It was easier for me.

482
0:32:34,000000 --> 0:32:34,990000
I admit it now.

483
0:32:36,000000 --> 0:32:36,990000
Although I didn't like writing it.

484
0:32:38,000000 --> 0:32:38,990000
I was hurt, wounded,

485
0:32:40,000000 --> 0:32:40,990000
and thrown out of your disappearance.

486
0:32:42,000000 --> 0:32:42,990000
Without a trace.

487
0:32:44,000000 --> 0:32:44,990000
I wanted to go to Triana in some way and I tried to do it because...

488
0:32:50,000000 --> 0:32:50,990000
I closed my ears for the personal information at the beginning. And then, when the columns with the persecution of the Bulgarians and Turks entered the news,

489
0:33:08,000000 --> 0:33:08,990000
I really felt like a master.

490
0:33:17,000000 --> 0:33:17,990000
I felt like many others.

491
0:33:21,000000 --> 0:33:21,990000
In unison with the propaganda, I told myself that there is a place there.

492
0:33:28,240000 --> 0:33:30,240000
My pride was hurt.

493
0:33:32,240000 --> 0:33:34,240000
And then a person becomes angry.

494
0:33:34,240000 --> 0:33:37,920000
He had got tired before the start of the event.

495
0:33:37,920000 --> 0:33:41,120000
I went and I christened the voice of my mind.

496
0:33:41,120000 --> 0:33:43,760000
I was young, in love, left behind.

497
0:33:43,760000 --> 0:33:46
I thought that our love is more important than a name.

498
0:33:46,000000 --> 0:33:46,990000
I wanted to forget everything.

499
0:33:48,000000 --> 0:33:48,990000
The time we were together, the oppressive feeling that the country was going through a terrible thing with these people.

500
0:33:55,000000 --> 0:33:55,990000
But I agreed with that, I agreed with the shame.

501
0:34:00,000000 --> 0:34:00,990000
It's hard to lie to yourself, but I did it.

502
0:34:04,000000 --> 0:34:04,990000
I wanted to look ahead.

503
0:34:06,000000 --> 0:34:06,990000
My life was ahead of me.

504
0:34:11,000000 --> 0:34:11,990000
I could guide it.

505
0:34:22,000000 --> 0:34:22,990000
I'm sorry.

506
0:34:33,000000 --> 0:34:33,990000
The life is passing by so fast.

507
0:34:42,000000 --> 0:34:42,990000
I'm not sure what would have happened if I had stayed here.

508
0:34:45,000000 --> 0:34:45,990000
I'm sure you've already lost your hair. How black your hair was!

509
0:34:48,000000 --> 0:34:48,990000
I've tarnished my hair.

510
0:34:51,000000 --> 0:34:51,990000
You're a light brown.

511
0:34:53,000000 --> 0:34:53,990000
It's gone to my eyes.

512
0:34:55,000000 --> 0:34:55,990000
I knew you'd done the only thing possible for you.

513
0:35:02,000000 --> 0:35:02,990000
You've always been reasonable. The only thing possible for you.

514
0:35:08,000000 --> 0:35:08,990000
You've always been reasonable. But I don't understand the magnitude of the tragedy.

515
0:35:13,000000 --> 0:35:13,990000
Maybe I was too young.

516
0:35:16,000000 --> 0:35:16,990000
It was more convenient for me to go on.

517
0:35:19,000000 --> 0:35:19,990000
On the other hand, you've been so close all the time.

518
0:35:25,000000 --> 0:35:25,990000
600 km away from the other country.

519
0:35:30,000000 --> 0:35:30,990000
This explains why I felt I was somewhere around.

520
0:35:37,000000 --> 0:35:37,990000
Here, next to me.

521
0:35:41,000000 --> 0:35:41,990000
I talked to you, Stepno.

522
0:35:44,000000 --> 0:35:44,990000
I imagined how you were getting older, your husband, your children.

523
0:35:54,000000 --> 0:35:54,990000
I understand now that you won't have...

524
0:35:59,000000 --> 0:35:59,990000
It's a pity, I really regret it.

525
0:36:02,000000 --> 0:36:02,990000
I'm really sorry.

526
0:36:09,000000 --> 0:36:09,990000
I thought that one day you would call me and keep silent, because how can you talk after so much time?

527
0:36:13,000000 --> 0:36:13,990000
How can you talk?

528
0:36:15,000000 --> 0:36:15,990000
It's better to keep silent.

529
0:36:21,000000 --> 0:36:21,990000
I remembered your taste.

530
0:36:24,000000 --> 0:36:24,990000
Your lips are delicious.

531
0:36:28,000000 --> 0:36:28,990000
That's it.

532
0:36:33,000000 --> 0:36:33,990000
I really knew that my feeling was not lying.

533
0:36:40,000000 --> 0:36:40,990000
It was not lying, but I couldn't wait for you. I just couldn't.

534
0:36:44,000000 --> 0:36:44,990000
There was no hope that something would change.

535
0:36:47,000000 --> 0:36:47,990000
They wouldn't let me leave, nor would I come back.

536
0:36:51,000000 --> 0:36:51,990000
I was in a daze.

537
0:36:54,000000 --> 0:36:54,990000
To say that I fell in love and that's why I gave birth to my children

538
0:36:59,000000 --> 0:36:59,990000
and that the point of time has passed is a bit overpowered.

539
0:37:03,000000 --> 0:37:03,990000
Today everything looks like a TV show.

540
0:37:08,000000 --> 0:37:08,990000
But often, under the surface of the calm lake,

541
0:37:12,000000 --> 0:37:12,990000
there is a strange creature hiding.

542
0:37:18,000000 --> 0:37:18,990000
It had to be done. I did what I did.

543
0:37:22,000000 --> 0:37:22,990000
I don't regret it anymore.

544
0:37:25,000000 --> 0:37:25,990000
For example, I was worried about you at the time.

545
0:37:29,000000 --> 0:37:29,990000
Today I couldn't experience such joy,

546
0:37:33,000000 --> 0:37:33,990000
nor such a strong excitement as I experience now,

547
0:37:37,000000 --> 0:37:37,990000
while he writes to you, you deserved it.

548
0:37:40,000000 --> 0:37:40,990000
How little are these moments in your life!

549
0:37:43,000000 --> 0:37:43,990000
In the present years,

550
0:37:45,000000 --> 0:37:45,990000
can allow me to turn back and say,

551
0:37:48,000000 --> 0:37:48,990000
pardon me, to write

552
0:37:51,000000 --> 0:37:51,990000
the highest moments

553
0:37:56,000000 --> 0:37:56,990000
whether I have lived my whole life

554
0:38:00,000000 --> 0:38:00,990000
because of a few reasons.

555
0:38:12,600000 --> 0:38:14,600000
My grandson always tells me

556
0:38:17,600000 --> 0:38:18,200000
that I open the letters to the neighbours, but I don't do it on purpose.

557
0:38:20,600000 --> 0:38:21,600000
And these are not exactly letters, they are notes.

558
0:38:24,600000 --> 0:38:25
Sometimes I write them back in the boxes.

559
0:38:26,000000 --> 0:38:26,990000
I open them carefully so that the letter is not on the wrong side.

560
0:38:32,000000 --> 0:38:32,990000
I have a neighbor from the upper floor.

561
0:38:34,000000 --> 0:38:34,990000
Damn woman!

562
0:38:35,000000 --> 0:38:35,990000
She is a wimp.

563
0:38:36,000000 --> 0:38:36,990000
She is afraid that I have been messing with her mail.

564
0:38:39,000000 --> 0:38:39,990000
I don't mess in the boxes.

565
0:38:41,000000 --> 0:38:41,990000
Because I don't see well, I read the name on the sheet.

566
0:38:44,000000 --> 0:38:44,990000
But the light at the entrance is so weak and I read't move. I don't see well, I read the name on the sheet. But the light is so weak in the entrance, I read everything wrong.

567
0:38:48,000000 --> 0:38:48,990000
I always read your name.

568
0:38:57,000000 --> 0:38:57,990000
I take a nap.

569
0:39:00,000000 --> 0:39:00,990000
And even at home I understand the mistake.

570
0:39:04,000000 --> 0:39:04,990000
Will I ever talk to her, listen to her whisper? I'm not going home until I understand my mistake.

571
0:39:08,000000 --> 0:39:08,990000
I won't argue with her, I won't listen to her whining. My grandson's sins that they had left me and that an old woman like me

572
0:39:12,000000 --> 0:39:12,990000
had a hard time doing things by herself, that I'm not with everyone.

573
0:39:15,000000 --> 0:39:15,990000
Here, exactly on these words, he will sometimes explode

574
0:39:19,000000 --> 0:39:19,990000
and will tell her what he thinks, but...

575
0:39:23,000000 --> 0:39:23,990000
I usually apologize honestly, but this time it's not like that.

576
0:39:30,000000 --> 0:39:30,990000
This time I read your name out loud.

577
0:39:34,000000 --> 0:39:34,990000
The letter from you.

578
0:39:39,000000 --> 0:39:39,990000
I was sure someone would get it.

579
0:39:44,000000 --> 0:39:44,990000
It started as usual.

580
0:39:51,000000 --> 0:39:51,990000
Hello, darling.

581
0:39:58,000000 --> 0:39:58,990000
I've started writing so many letters to you.

582
0:40:00,000000 --> 0:40:00,990000
First on the phone, then on the paper.

583
0:40:04,000000 --> 0:40:04,990000
But I don't have an address. I collect them in to the office first, then to the library.

584
0:40:07,000000 --> 0:40:07,990000
I don't have an address. I'm collecting them in the closet, in the green folder.

585
0:40:11,000000 --> 0:40:11,990000
I'll send them to you some day.

586
0:40:16,000000 --> 0:40:16,990000
Or maybe I'll give them to you in the river, who knows? The The The The The

587
0:40:25,480000 --> 0:40:26,480000
The

588
0:40:26,480000 --> 0:40:27,480000
The

589
0:40:27,480000 --> 0:40:28,480000
The

590
0:40:28,480000 --> 0:40:29,480000
The

591
0:40:29,480000 --> 0:40:30,480000
The

592
0:40:30,480000 --> 0:40:31,480000
The

593
0:40:31,480000 --> 0:40:32,480000
The

594
0:40:32,480000 --> 0:40:33,480000
The

595
0:40:33,480000 --> 0:40:34,480000
The

596
0:40:34,480000 --> 0:40:35,480000
The

597
0:40:35,480000 --> 0:40:36,480000
The

598
0:40:36,480000 --> 0:40:37,480000
The

599
0:40:37,480000 --> 0:40:38,480000
The

600
0:40:38,480000 --> 0:40:39,480000
The

601
0:40:39,480000 --> 0:40:40,480000
The

602
0:40:40,480000 --> 0:40:41,480000
The

603
0:40:41,480000 --> 0:40:42,480000
The

604
0:40:42,480000 --> 0:40:43,480000
The

605
0:40:43,480000 --> 0:40:44,480000
The

606
0:40:44,480000 --> 0:40:45
The The The The The Even after a smoked cigarette.

607
0:40:48,000000 --> 0:40:48,990000
Then he blows on it for a long time. He's very careful.

608
0:40:50,000000 --> 0:40:50,990000
When I fall asleep, he writes

609
0:40:53,000000 --> 0:40:53,990000
with a prayer between his fingers,

610
0:40:56,000000 --> 0:40:56,990000
he doesn't wake me up.

611
0:40:58,000000 --> 0:40:58,990000
He just pulls it out slightly,

612
0:41:00,000000 --> 0:41:00,990000
he takes off the sheet

613
0:41:02,000000 --> 0:41:02,990000
and leaves me to snore. I don't believe that I just kept on reading.

614
0:41:05,000000 --> 0:41:05,990000
I don't believe I'm reading what's written, because I know it's something personal, only mine.

615
0:41:14,000000 --> 0:41:14,990000
But now I'm very relieved.

616
0:41:18,000000 --> 0:41:18,990000
The letter brings back my hope that time will go back.

617
0:41:28,000000 --> 0:41:28,990000
And on the question I started writing to you,

618
0:41:34,000000 --> 0:41:34,990000
to ask you something,

619
0:41:38,000000 --> 0:41:38,990000
my grandson, as he understood, is a boy.

620
0:41:43,000000 --> 0:41:43,990000
I'm a boy and...

621
0:41:49,000000 --> 0:41:49,990000
I'm in love again.

622
0:41:55,000000 --> 0:41:55,990000
I'll stay, I pray. Is it bright? It's bright.

623
0:41:59,000000 --> 0:41:59,990000
I'm watching...

624
0:42:02,000000 --> 0:42:02,990000
...how it's getting lighter.

625
0:42:05,000000 --> 0:42:05,990000
The blue clouds are getting darker.

626
0:42:09,000000 --> 0:42:09,990000
And I can barely see what's written.

627
0:42:13,000000 --> 0:42:13,990000
Even the glasses.

628
0:42:16,000000 --> 0:42:16,990000
I'll have to turn on the light before it gets dark.

629
0:42:23,000000 --> 0:42:23,990000
Wait for me.

630
0:42:26,000000 --> 0:42:26,990000
I will continue in a bit. ¶¶
