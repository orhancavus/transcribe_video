1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
The story of the human spirit

2
0:00:07,000000 --> 0:00:07,990000
Stories of past events, of the power of the human spirit and the powerlessness of the system,

3
0:00:12,000000 --> 0:00:12,990000
of freedom and its price,

4
0:00:14,000000 --> 0:00:14,990000
have chosen the truth instead of the lies.

5
0:00:17,000000 --> 0:00:17,990000
This is their story.

6
0:00:19,000000 --> 0:00:19,990000
The story of the human spirit The The village of Benkovski is located in the center of the village of Benkovski. I think it was the first time I came here at the age of 5-6 years.

7
0:01:08,000000 --> 0:01:08,990000
I thought it was the center of the world.

8
0:01:11,000000 --> 0:01:11,990000
People gathered here on the market and came to the Friday prayer.

9
0:01:18,000000 --> 0:01:18,990000
The village had 18,000 people. After the people were exiled,

10
0:01:28,000000 --> 0:01:28,990000
there were about 10,000 people left.

11
0:02:09,000000 --> 0:02:09,990000
The I was working in the barracks in Sofia. I worked as a cook and a waiter in the church. After the barracks, because there was no work in our region,

12
0:02:14,000000 --> 0:02:14,990000
I went to work as a cook in Erma River.

13
0:02:19,000000 --> 0:02:19,990000
Then I moved to work as a cook in our village of Benkovski.

14
0:02:25,000000 --> 0:02:25,990000
There I met friends who are engaged in music.

15
0:02:30,000000 --> 0:02:30,990000
I had a desire to play and I had an old guitar.

16
0:02:36,000000 --> 0:02:36,990000
So my musical path began.

17
0:02:40,000000 --> 0:02:40,990000
I played in a restaurant, we played weddings.

18
0:02:43,000000 --> 0:02:43,990000
There was work and we earned profit, we were happy.

19
0:02:46,800000 --> 0:02:49,200000
We went to Burgas.

20
0:02:49,200000 --> 0:02:57,800000
There I met students, students, intelligence from the Turkish East.

21
0:02:57,800000 --> 0:03:05
I contacted them and I had a lot of time for rehearsals and reading books.

22
0:03:05,000000 --> 0:03:05,990000
Law, criminology, history of diplomacy, constitution.

23
0:03:15,000000 --> 0:03:15,990000
This lasted until 1984. In 2008, one evening, they surrounded our district and started to gather people.

24
0:03:32,000000 --> 0:03:32,990000
We went out to protest. There was nothing organized, but suddenly, in a few hours, about 10,000 people gathered in a part of the village. We saw that people were being shot,

25
0:03:49,000000 --> 0:03:49,990000
people were being chased with BTRs, fire trucks, jeeps, people were being arrested.

26
0:03:56,000000 --> 0:03:56,990000
We heard that there were victims.

27
0:03:59,000000 --> 0:03:59,990000
I was baptized as Mitko Asenov Yosefov Milanov.

28
0:04:05,000000 --> 0:04:05,990000
I was crazy.

29
0:04:08,000000 --> 0:04:08,990000
I was standing in front of a tent for I don't know how many hours,

30
0:04:13,000000 --> 0:04:13,990000
I don't know how I was standing there, what I felt, what I thought, I don't remember.

31
0:04:22,000000 --> 0:04:22,990000
And then I said, I will do something that our intelligentsia have not done,

32
0:04:37,000000 --> 0:04:37,990000
who knew that they would change their names.

33
0:04:41,000000 --> 0:04:41,990000
I thought a lot about how I could do something. I was looking to organize something.

34
0:04:49,000000 --> 0:04:49,990000
How to organize? My job was purely journalistic, to collect information and to publish abroad.

35
0:04:59,000000 --> 0:04:59,990000
How to publish abroad but with the embassy. Another thing is that there are students.

36
0:05:06,000000 --> 0:05:06,990000
Who will find these students?

37
0:05:09,000000 --> 0:05:09,990000
Students from the Russian political community.

38
0:05:12,000000 --> 0:05:12,990000
In Russian, everything is secret, you won't tell them, even to me.

39
0:05:16,000000 --> 0:05:16,990000
The boys quickly understood what was going on.

40
0:05:19,000000 --> 0:05:19,990000
We won't have names, some of the students said.

41
0:05:23,000000 --> 0:05:23,990000
The long winter started as a code between us to make.

42
0:05:28,000000 --> 0:05:28,990000
It was a very long and cold winter, this same winter.

43
0:05:32,000000 --> 0:05:32,990000
The birds were charging in the trees.

44
0:05:37,000000 --> 0:05:37,990000
And that's why the long winter remained.

45
0:05:40,000000 --> 0:05:40,990000
We already know that state state security between us. We have made a thick network between workers and everywhere where there are Turks.

46
0:05:50,000000 --> 0:05:50,990000
I already knew in the city who is following us, I knew the agents.

47
0:05:55,000000 --> 0:05:55,990000
We started running and they are running after us.

48
0:05:58,000000 --> 0:05:58,990000
We started playing with them.

49
0:06:00,000000 --> 0:06:00,990000
And we did this as a toy, but we do our jobs.

50
0:06:07,000000 --> 0:06:07,990000
The second thing we have to do is to send this people to protests.

51
0:06:13,000000 --> 0:06:13,990000
I said then that we would fall into the movement of the Russian Federation of Bulgaria.

52
0:06:19,000000 --> 0:06:19,990000
But we never talked about the end. We can't act like communists.

53
0:06:25,000000 --> 0:06:25,990000
There will be no difference between communists and us, Muslim believers.

54
0:06:30,000000 --> 0:06:30,990000
They are infidels. The story of the first time I was born in the village of Krasnoyarsk The story of the first time I was born in the village of Krasnoyarsk The story of the first time I was born in the village of Krasnoyarsk

60
0:06:56,000000 --> 0:06:56,990000

61
0:06:58,000000 --> 0:06:58,990000

62
0:07:00,000000 --> 0:07:00,990000

63
0:07:02,000000 --> 0:07:02,990000
The story of the first time I was born in the village of Krasnoyarsk

64
0:07:04,000000 --> 0:07:04,990000
The story of the first time I was born in the village of Krasnoyarsk The story of the first time I was born in the village of Krasnoyarsk I played here with my friends. It was a big stadium back then, that's how I saw it.

65
0:07:06,000000 --> 0:07:06,990000
They gathered here, they didn't let me go much,

66
0:07:08,600000 --> 0:07:12,320000
because they were afraid that something would happen to me,

67
0:07:12,320000 --> 0:07:14,800000
so I threw my friends here.

68
0:07:14,800000 --> 0:07:18,480000
I'm a little more polite than the others.

69
0:07:18,480000 --> 0:07:25
There are so many things to talk about, but how to express all this?

70
0:07:26,000000 --> 0:07:26,990000
This house has been searched for dozens of times because of me.

71
0:07:30,000000 --> 0:07:30,990000
I have been digging everywhere. My parents have been tormented because of me.

72
0:07:36,000000 --> 0:07:36,990000
My children have been crying for years without me.

73
0:07:41,000000 --> 0:07:41,990000
And this cannot be described at all.

74
0:07:46,500000 --> 0:07:50
Can there be such words, to be able to describe?

75
0:07:50,000000 --> 0:07:50,990000
And so it went on. I was ready to be arrested.

76
0:07:55,000000 --> 0:07:55,990000
The head of the factory, Marshal Tolbukhin, called me into his office.

77
0:08:01,000000 --> 0:08:01,990000
I went to him and and two people who said,

78
0:08:05,000000 --> 0:08:05,990000
''Eat with me!'' came to him.

79
0:08:07,000000 --> 0:08:07,990000
''I know what you want to do.''

80
0:08:09,000000 --> 0:08:09,990000
''Calm down.''

81
0:08:10,000000 --> 0:08:10,990000
''I've been waiting for you.''

82
0:08:12,000000 --> 0:08:12,990000
A black car was waiting for me outside with a wheelchair in the back.

83
0:08:18,000000 --> 0:08:18,990000
They drove me to Rzvigor, Sofia.

84
0:08:21,000000 --> 0:08:21,990000
They started accusing me, '' a spy and a terrorist.

85
0:08:25,000000 --> 0:08:25,990000
I asked them what they were talking about.

86
0:08:30,000000 --> 0:08:30,990000
They asked if I had any evidence.

87
0:08:33,000000 --> 0:08:33,990000
I said I had no evidence.

88
0:08:36,000000 --> 0:08:36,990000
The first day, a diplomatic suitcase opened and a bullet from the inside he threw a hammer.

89
0:08:49,000000 --> 0:08:49,990000
He said, here is the evidence. And so the first murder started.

90
0:08:54,000000 --> 0:08:54,990000
Some with a gun, some with a hammer. Then they transferred me to the Sofian prison.

91
0:09:07,000000 --> 0:09:07,990000
There is a heavy cellar there, which is a single cell.

92
0:09:12,000000 --> 0:09:12,990000
I stayed there for a year.

93
0:09:16,000000 --> 0:09:16,990000
For the first time I escaped.

94
0:09:18,000000 --> 0:09:18,990000
More than 100 days passed.

95
0:09:21,000000 --> 0:09:21,990000
And this in cold water.

96
0:09:24,000000 --> 0:09:24,990000
Miseries.

97
0:09:26,000000 --> 0:09:26,990000
Sometimes you become hungry.

98
0:09:28,000000 --> 0:09:28,990000
You can beat your heart out of it.

99
0:09:32,000000 --> 0:09:32,990000
As you wish.

100
0:09:34,000000 --> 0:09:34,990000
And so the days passed.

101
0:09:36,000000 --> 0:09:36,990000
How do the days pass?

102
0:09:40,000000 --> 0:09:40,990000
Prayers, singing.

103
0:09:44,000000 --> 0:09:44,990000
Years and something. I have never seen the sun. prayers, singing.

104
0:09:45,000000 --> 0:09:45,990000
For years and something I have not seen the sun at all.

105
0:09:49,000000 --> 0:09:49,990000
Maybe for a year and a half.

106
0:09:52,000000 --> 0:09:52,990000
One day I got out of the cell

107
0:09:55,000000 --> 0:09:55,990000
and they put me in this Strasbourg prison.

108
0:10:00,000000 --> 0:10:00,990000
I weakened almost like a skeleton. I was already in prison, in the political prison.

109
0:10:12,000000 --> 0:10:12,990000
And there I was met with great emotion,

110
0:10:17,000000 --> 0:10:17,990000
because there I understood that I was in the biggest prison.

111
0:10:23,000000 --> 0:10:23,990000
There I understood that I was in the prison with the biggest prisoner. There I understood that I am the one who entered the prison with the newest people.

112
0:10:30,000000 --> 0:10:30,990000
I understood that I am the biggest leader.

113
0:10:34,000000 --> 0:10:34,990000
I am a village boy.

114
0:10:36,000000 --> 0:10:36,990000
I understood that without planning, without wanting, I have organized the largest illegal organization in Bulgaria,

115
0:10:45,000000 --> 0:10:45,990000
to protect the rights of the Turks and the Muslims.

116
0:10:49,000000 --> 0:10:49,990000
They were very angry with me.

117
0:10:52,000000 --> 0:10:52,990000
Where did you go with this middle education,

118
0:10:55,000000 --> 0:10:55,990000
with musician, builder, to confront each other,

119
0:10:59,000000 --> 0:10:59,990000
to organize such things?

120
0:11:01,000000 --> 0:11:01,990000
I know I can't.

121
0:11:03,000000 --> 0:11:03,990000
I fight as much as I can.

122
0:11:06,000000 --> 0:11:06,990000
After a while, instead of saying something, some of us were gathered in a salon.

123
0:11:15,000000 --> 0:11:15,990000
They wanted to show us their yaga, they wanted to respect us, they want to promise us something. They say, do you have anything to say?

124
0:11:27,000000 --> 0:11:27,990000
Everyone is looking at me, I have to say something again.

125
0:11:32,000000 --> 0:11:32,990000
I say, I will say. You came here to threaten us,

126
0:11:36,000000 --> 0:11:36,990000
are you afraid to threaten us? I say, directly.

127
0:11:38,000000 --> 0:11:38,990000
You can't promise anything, you only know how to kill.

128
0:11:43,000000 --> 0:11:43,990000
You killed a child, You killed innocent people.

129
0:11:48,000000 --> 0:11:48,990000
You killed my friend in prison. What do you think you can do?

130
0:11:54,000000 --> 0:11:54,990000
We will not give up. We are ready to fight and we will fight.

131
0:11:59,000000 --> 0:11:59,990000
I will get out of this out with a Turkish name. The The The The The

153
0:13:17,000000 --> 0:13:17,990000

154
0:13:35,000000 --> 0:13:35,990000
And what happened next? After a few days, I was taken to a prison.

I was walking and walking and walking and where?

To the prison.

157
0:13:57,000000 --> 0:13:57,990000
I don't know where I came from, and I don't know where I came from. For the first time I see what the prison looks like from the outside. What is a prison outside?

158
0:14:12,000000 --> 0:14:12,990000
We were taken to a room, there were 15-20 people, officers and civilians.

159
0:14:21,000000 --> 0:14:21,990000
I came in and one of them asked for permission.

160
0:14:26,000000 --> 0:14:26,990000
I looked at him and asked, what permission? From whom?

161
0:14:31,000000 --> 0:14:31,990000
I asked, where is he? He said, he is at the top.

162
0:14:37,000000 --> 0:14:37,990000
I asked, what do you want me to do? He said, do it.

163
0:14:41,000000 --> 0:14:41,990000
Will you punish me? You punished me.

164
0:14:44,000000 --> 0:14:44,990000
I was 15 for 15 months.

165
0:14:50,000000 --> 0:14:50,990000
I am not afraid of that. You killed me. This body has nowhere to go.

166
0:14:56,000000 --> 0:14:56,990000
You left me hungry. You took my dignity, my pride. You took everything.

167
0:15:05,000000 --> 0:15:05,990000
I said, you took my pride, you took everything from me, and you still scare me. Who are you scaring? Do it directly, I said.

168
0:15:08,000000 --> 0:15:08,990000
Until I am like the other prison guards, I will never be reconciled.

169
0:15:13,000000 --> 0:15:13,990000
If you don't cause me problems, I won't cause you problems.

170
0:15:17,000000 --> 0:15:17,990000
But if you cause me problems, I will not come back.

171
0:15:20,000000 --> 0:15:20,990000
I have come to die.

172
0:15:23,000000 --> 0:15:23,990000
What are you expecting? That's why I am here to die. What do you expect?

173
0:15:25,000000 --> 0:15:25,990000
That's why I came here. That's why I was separated.

174
0:15:29,000000 --> 0:15:29,990000
I am different from the others.

175
0:15:32,000000 --> 0:15:32,990000
I am not some wild animal to be trained.

176
0:15:37,000000 --> 0:15:37,990000
You won't train me. I can die.

177
0:15:40,000000 --> 0:15:40,990000
They took me to a corridor in a bedroom, 70-80 people, and I was lying there, two or three.

178
0:15:55,000000 --> 0:15:55,990000
There was no one, only one sleeping inside. I saw the prisoners working. I saw myself in a miracle.

179
0:16:06,000000 --> 0:16:06,990000
It was summer time.

180
0:16:08,000000 --> 0:16:08,990000
Those sweaters or the goli from above,

181
0:16:11,000000 --> 0:16:11,990000
everything was in tattoos.

182
0:16:14,000000 --> 0:16:14,990000
Everything was written.

183
0:16:17,000000 --> 0:16:17,990000
I, as an agent, I have nothing,

184
0:16:20,000000 --> 0:16:20,990000
only one dot.

185
0:16:23,000000 --> 0:16:23,990000
He said, who are you?

186
0:16:26,000000 --> 0:16:26,990000
I said, I am Mohamed.

187
0:16:29,000000 --> 0:16:29,990000
You haven't changed, have you?

188
0:16:32,000000 --> 0:16:32,990000
He said, no one can change my name.

189
0:16:35,000000 --> 0:16:35,990000
So, the prisoners, where are you from?

190
0:16:38,000000 --> 0:16:38,990000
None of them want to believe that I am for the names.

191
0:16:44,000000 --> 0:16:44,990000
There are no such people here, there are no police prisoners.

192
0:16:48,000000 --> 0:16:48,990000
I said, there are, there are, I am here.

193
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
And so I met the Lissidivists.

194
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
I will tell you in detail, I saw the most dignified people there,

195
0:17:00,000000 --> 0:17:00,990000
the most tough people, the most organized people.

196
0:17:05,000000 --> 0:17:05,990000
I have seen such a relationship with civilians.

197
0:17:12,000000 --> 0:17:12,990000
These people, I say, how did they get here?

198
0:17:18,000000 --> 0:17:18,990000
I'm serious.

199
0:17:21,000000 --> 0:17:21,990000
I started organizing the organization from there.

200
0:17:26,000000 --> 0:17:26,990000
I didn't tell them that I send letters, draw.

201
0:17:31,000000 --> 0:17:31,990000
Through them I sent letters to my people outside.

202
0:17:36,000000 --> 0:17:36,990000
In these cards there is a drawing of some caricature or a card, something interesting for the children.

203
0:17:50,000000 --> 0:17:50,990000
But actually there is an empty sheet,

204
0:17:54,000000 --> 0:17:54,990000
between this empty sheet I put the card in a envelope and it passes.

205
0:17:59,000000 --> 0:17:59,990000
But actually on this sheet there is a letter written with citric acid or fruit juice written on it.

206
0:18:10,000000 --> 0:18:10,990000
And my people read it outside, calmly.

207
0:18:14,000000 --> 0:18:14,990000
And the conspiracy is already being made.

208
0:18:17,000000 --> 0:18:17,990000
Everything is being prepared outside and they are just waiting for my date.

209
0:18:22,000000 --> 0:18:22,990000
and they just wait for the date.

210
0:18:30,800000 --> 0:18:37,200000
I stayed here for about three years, from which I was in the unit, alone in the cell, for about seven months.

211
0:18:37,200000 --> 0:18:46
In general, when I was in prison, I was alone in the cell for two years in Kiliya.

212
0:18:46,000000 --> 0:18:46,990000
I have made about ten hunger strikes here.

213
0:18:51,000000 --> 0:18:51,990000
One of my biggest strikes is about 20 days.

214
0:18:56,000000 --> 0:18:56,990000
I carry the name of the long winter because my friends,

215
0:19:00,000000 --> 0:19:00,990000
before I moved out, gave this name to my family in Turkey. Otherwise, my family was named after me.

216
0:19:05,000000 --> 0:19:05,990000
Otherwise, my name would have been Tih Vaglen, Sakinkor.

217
0:19:10,000000 --> 0:19:10,990000
Because the prison was called Tih Vaglen.

218
0:19:14,000000 --> 0:19:14,990000
That's what the police said.

219
0:19:19,000000 --> 0:19:19,990000
Because I was messing very mysterious man.

220
0:19:45,000000 --> 0:19:45,990000
One day I was on duty to be thrown out of the building.

221
0:19:53,000000 --> 0:19:53,990000
On the first floor of the corridor I saw three people,

222
0:19:58,000000 --> 0:19:58,990000
two of whom I know from the Straszegorski prison,

223
0:20:02,000000 --> 0:20:02,990000
and the third was a weak, grumpy man.

224
0:20:05,000000 --> 0:20:05,990000
I asked him who he was. He said, he is bigger than you.

225
0:20:08,000000 --> 0:20:08,990000
How is that bigger than me?

226
0:20:10,000000 --> 0:20:10,990000
He is also an organization and a philosopher.

227
0:20:16,000000 --> 0:20:16,990000
I said, how can he be bigger than me?

228
0:20:19,000000 --> 0:20:19,990000
I instantly envied him.

229
0:20:25,000000 --> 0:20:25,990000
This is Ahmed Doan.

230
0:20:29,000000 --> 0:20:29,990000
We met and I let my people learn what this man is.

231
0:20:39,000000 --> 0:20:39,990000
After three months or more, they said that Ahmed was the salt of a soldier in the barracks.

232
0:20:48,000000 --> 0:20:48,990000
When he was in the barracks.

233
0:20:50,000000 --> 0:20:50,990000
Now, I thought a lot about it.

234
0:20:53,000000 --> 0:20:53,990000
Everyone can be a soldier of a soldier, educated person.

235
0:20:59,000000 --> 0:20:59,990000
And to be, however, I needed a person like Ahmed Doan. I needed a label.

236
0:21:12,000000 --> 0:21:12,990000
My label is a builder, a cook, a musician with a middle education.

237
0:21:21,000000 --> 0:21:21,990000
I had to use it because because I can't carry this stuff.

238
0:21:27,000000 --> 0:21:27,990000
This is a burning ball for me, which I have to transfer to another.

239
0:21:35,000000 --> 0:21:35,990000
Ahmed did very well, he offered me, if I wanted, to introduce you from the beginning. I'm waiting for that.

240
0:21:46,000000 --> 0:21:46,990000
But how can I call this organization?

241
0:21:51,000000 --> 0:21:51,990000
This organization, as I said, we call it,

242
0:21:55,000000 --> 0:21:55,990000
we only two say it,

243
0:21:57,000000 --> 0:21:57,990000
Movement for Rights and Freedom.

244
0:21:59,000000 --> 0:21:59,990000
We did not talk about organizing a party with him,

245
0:22:03,000000 --> 0:22:03,990000
but only about the movement.

246
0:22:05,000000 --> 0:22:05,990000
And this movement was to organize these protests.

247
0:22:11,000000 --> 0:22:11,990000
From there he continued. He continued, and I stayed in prison for another 7 months.

248
0:22:18,000000 --> 0:22:18,990000
Now, the prison management and the people I contacted in the prison officers, they always told me that my friend had left the prison on purpose.

249
0:22:31,000000 --> 0:22:31,990000
They were talking about Ahmed. He had left the prison on purpose, so that I wouldn't interfere in his work.

250
0:22:54,000000 --> 0:22:54,990000
We are in front of the Turkian spring. Here, every year on December 26, people come from all over Bulgaria and Turkey, from everywhere, so that they can remember that day

251
0:23:06,000000 --> 0:23:06,990000
for the victims of the totalitarian regime.

252
0:23:10,000000 --> 0:23:10,990000
The name of the one who killed the Turkian, Musa and Ayse is known.

253
0:23:17,000000 --> 0:23:17,990000
But they did nothing.

254
0:23:19,000000 --> 0:23:19,990000
We talked to the chief prosecutor, the military prosecutor, the ombudsman.

255
0:23:30,000000 --> 0:23:30,990000
We were all the prosecutors, all the possible institutions.

256
0:23:35,000000 --> 0:23:35,990000
We fought for over 30 years after the prison.

257
0:23:39,000000 --> 0:23:39,990000
But nothing. Nothing.

258
0:23:42,000000 --> 0:23:42,990000
They don't accept our complaints documents so that they can review our case again.

259
0:23:47,000000 --> 0:23:47,990000
So that the real statement can be published. That's what we want.

260
0:23:52,000000 --> 0:23:52,990000
After I got out of prison, I was greeted with my friends, with rallies.

261
0:24:00,000000 --> 0:24:00,990000
I was kissed from everywhere. I was hug of Gorshtan, from the village of Slunki.

262
0:24:05,600000 --> 0:24:09,600000
I said to those people, how much I am loved.

263
0:24:09,600000 --> 0:24:15,600000
They expected me to stay here and participate in the political life in Bulgaria.

264
0:24:15,600000 --> 0:24:53
In the end I said that I would travel to Turkey, I was already settled. The next day, my't pay attention to me, because I wouldn't be Bulgarian, I wouldn't be a politician.

265
0:24:54,000000 --> 0:24:54,990000
Then I realized that these people were hoping for some interest, they came to me or they were afraid of me.

266
0:25:03,000000 --> 0:25:03,990000
They either stayed with me or were afraid of me.

267
0:25:07,000000 --> 0:25:07,990000
They offered me money, but I didn't take it.

268
0:25:11,000000 --> 0:25:11,990000
Everything was a lie, it collapsed.

269
0:25:15,000000 --> 0:25:15,990000
The balloon broke down in one day, in one evening.

270
0:25:24,000000 --> 0:25:24,990000
Here, from this stand, the big people climb up and talk each other on the back.

271
0:25:25,000000 --> 0:25:25,990000
They are so impudent that it is impossible.

272
0:25:29,000000 --> 0:25:29,990000
They don't let me talk here. What do you expect?

273
0:25:33,000000 --> 0:25:33,990000
I am a hero who is getting out of here.

274
0:25:37,000000 --> 0:25:37,990000
I am there. They don't let me talk.

275
0:25:41,000000 --> 0:25:41,990000
Or vice versa. They climb up, beat each other on the back.

276
0:25:46,000000 --> 0:25:46,990000
We watch them from here, the repressed.

277
0:25:48,000000 --> 0:25:48,990000
And from here they go for a cocktail.

278
0:25:52,000000 --> 0:25:52,990000
In the evenings they are drunk, not sober.

279
0:25:56,000000 --> 0:25:56,990000
They climb up on the stands again,

280
0:25:58,000000 --> 0:25:58,990000
beat each other on the back,

281
0:26:00,000000 --> 0:26:00,990000
and then they go to drink.

282
0:26:02,000000 --> 0:26:02,990000
I can't be a politician because I can't drink that much.

283
0:26:06,000000 --> 0:26:06,990000
I was just a fighter. I went out of prison.

284
0:26:12,000000 --> 0:26:12,990000
I did what I had to do.

285
0:26:16,000000 --> 0:26:16,990000
I thought I would go out of prison, they would return my name and I will continue with the music.

286
0:26:28,000000 --> 0:26:28,990000
This is how I imagined it.

287
0:26:30,000000 --> 0:26:30,990000
But in fact, nothing happened as I imagined it. The Thank you for watching!
