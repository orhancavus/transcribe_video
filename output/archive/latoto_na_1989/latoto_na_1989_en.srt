The The The The The I was a young programmer in the head office of the Ministry of Future Energy.

25
0:00:30,000000 --> 0:00:30,990000
I worked there for a while, around 3-4 years.

26
0:00:34,000000 --> 0:00:34,990000
I lived a selfless life, programming had become a modern profession.

27
0:00:47,000000 --> 0:00:47,990000
I had a modern profession and I didn't have a bad day. My life was getting better and better.

28
0:00:50,000000 --> 0:00:50,990000
I was 30 years old and I was doing well.

29
0:00:53,000000 --> 0:00:53,990000
What was the end of your life?

30
0:00:56,000000 --> 0:00:56,990000
In 1989, it was the end of something that was very abstract at that time for people like me who lived in Sofia.

31
0:01:06,000000 --> 0:01:06,990000
We knew that something was going on, which was officially called then,

32
0:01:11,000000 --> 0:01:11,990000
and now someone allows himself to talk about the renaissance process.

33
0:01:14,000000 --> 0:01:14,990000
I say allows because it is not only for Bulgaria,

34
0:01:18,000000 --> 0:01:18,990000
the word renaissance has something positive in it, something good.

35
0:01:22,000000 --> 0:01:22,990000
People call it renaissance, and so on. But this is exactly the opposite.

36
0:01:28,000000 --> 0:01:28,990000
But this is the kind of thing that was a process

37
0:01:32,000000 --> 0:01:32,990000
with the writer's pre-election regime.

38
0:01:34,000000 --> 0:01:34,990000
I will call it that, because I accept this name,

39
0:01:37,000000 --> 0:01:37,990000
because it was his official name to this day.

40
0:01:42,000000 --> 0:01:42,990000
So we knew that something was wrong with the country.

41
0:01:45,000000 --> 0:01:45,990000
We knew that there were problems with the Turkish youth, with the pomashko.

42
0:01:51,000000 --> 0:01:51,990000
I personally have not contacted such people in my life.

43
0:01:55,000000 --> 0:01:55,990000
I only saw the pomashko when I was in the barracks.

44
0:01:58,000000 --> 0:01:58,990000
We heard that their names were changed.

45
0:02:01,000000 --> 0:02:01,990000
During these times, not only did the names change on the table,

46
0:02:05,000000 --> 0:02:05,990000
there were also lists with allowed names.

47
0:02:08,000000 --> 0:02:08,990000
We understood that this was a kind of humiliation.

48
0:02:11,000000 --> 0:02:11,990000
But when a person knows it abstractly, he does not realize the power of this humiliation.

49
0:02:17,000000 --> 0:02:17,990000
In 1989, they obviously decided to reach a critical point,

50
0:02:22,000000 --> 0:02:22,990000
that is, they becamebearable. Then the incursion began, which was officially explained as a voluntary desire of the people who do not feel themselves Bulgarians to leave the country.

51
0:02:33,000000 --> 0:02:33,990000
Until these people in these areas were engaged mainly in agriculture.

52
0:02:38,000000 --> 0:02:38,990000
Then there was no such action against the trampling that is still going on today, but it was obviously an operation for the arrival of the city, which today is being held, but which was obviously an operation to prevent the future of the country.

53
0:02:46,000000 --> 0:02:46,990000
At that time, the record of the city was paid mainly to be destroyed by the Tudor Empire for this year,

54
0:02:52,000000 --> 0:02:52,990000
and not only that, but then a call was made to the rest of the patriotic-minded future population

55
0:02:59,000000 --> 0:02:59,990000
to help their country, which fell into such a trouble because of some predators, and to help these regions to collect the harvest.

56
0:03:09,000000 --> 0:03:09,990000
What developed later was that some orders were released,

57
0:03:12,000000 --> 0:03:12,990000
that is, any company, no matter what it is,

58
0:03:16,000000 --> 0:03:16,990000
to assign people who would go to these places for 14 to 20 days

59
0:03:22,000000 --> 0:03:22,990000
and to help with the construction work.

60
0:03:25,000000 --> 0:03:25,990000
When we got off the bus, we were in a very picturesque hut,

61
0:03:29,000000 --> 0:03:29,990000
where we saw the wild boars.

62
0:03:31,000000 --> 0:03:31,990000
It was a beautiful place, with some wild boars and some sheep.

63
0:03:35,000000 --> 0:03:35,990000
It was a very beautiful place,

64
0:03:37,000000 --> 0:03:37,990000
and even if you were there on a vacation,

65
0:03:40,000000 --> 0:03:40,990000
it would be very pleasant to see.

66
0:03:43,000000 --> 0:03:43,990000
The first thing we saw in the village, which we can now describe as a Turkish village,

67
0:03:48,000000 --> 0:03:48,990000
they were still slightly late, there were some people.

68
0:03:52,000000 --> 0:03:52,990000
What shocked me was that we met on the bus, two or three children came,

69
0:03:58,000000 --> 0:03:58,990000
they sat down and said, I heard something, some bread, do you have some bread?

70
0:04:02,000000 --> 0:04:02,990000
This was quite unusual. It was a typical situation.

71
0:04:05,000000 --> 0:04:05,990000
But then we started to follow them.

72
0:04:09,000000 --> 0:04:09,990000
They were small people who were working for the local population.

73
0:04:13,000000 --> 0:04:13,990000
The process was not only changing their names.

74
0:04:16,000000 --> 0:04:16,990000
When there was a funeral, they were taking their names

75
0:04:20,000000 --> 0:04:20,990000
to their grandfathers and grandmothers and they were still buried in Budva.

76
0:04:23,000000 --> 0:04:23,990000
This alone shows a very big decline.

77
0:04:27,000000 --> 0:04:27,990000
But it's the way it is.

78
0:04:29,000000 --> 0:04:29,990000
In particular, in the work of this cemetery,

79
0:04:32,000000 --> 0:04:32,990000
we were on the side and we were having lunch,

80
0:04:34,000000 --> 0:04:34,990000
after some work in the city,

81
0:04:37,000000 --> 0:04:37,990000
and I jokingly said that this work should end well,

82
0:04:40,000000 --> 0:04:40,990000
because whoever demolishes the cemetery, they become white.

83
0:04:43,000000 --> 0:04:43,990000
I was joking a joke.

84
0:04:46,000000 --> 0:04:46,990000
But fortunately, our party secretary

85
0:04:48,000000 --> 0:04:48,990000
fell and broke her head.

86
0:04:50,000000 --> 0:04:50,990000
She fell and I broke a stone.

87
0:04:52,000000 --> 0:04:52,990000
So,

88
0:04:54,000000 --> 0:04:54,990000
I had to be taken to Kyrgyzstan

89
0:04:56,000000 --> 0:04:56,990000
to the hospital.

90
0:04:58,000000 --> 0:04:58,990000
We took a car there

91
0:05:00,000000 --> 0:05:00,990000
and I was standing there,

92
0:05:02,000000 --> 0:05:02,990000
because I was still traveling.

93
0:05:04,000000 --> 0:05:04,990000
We had a good relationship with her. So I was taken to the K of the others, because we were traveling together. I met them, we had good relations, we were friends.

94
0:05:06,000000 --> 0:05:06,990000
So I got into the Kyrgyz hospital.

95
0:05:09,000000 --> 0:05:09,990000
This is a very important description.

96
0:05:11,000000 --> 0:05:11,990000
In the Kyrgyz hospital, we got in a car,

97
0:05:14,000000 --> 0:05:14,990000
some woman was waiting for us in the front, this is the situation.

98
0:05:17,000000 --> 0:05:17,990000
The first thing they asked us at the entrance was,

99
0:05:21,000000 --> 0:05:21,990000
Are you Turkish?

100
0:05:24,000000 --> 0:05:24,990000
We said, not only that we are not only Turks, but also brigadiers.

101
0:05:29,000000 --> 0:05:29,990000
They came to us.

102
0:05:32,000000 --> 0:05:32,990000
The sister who came to us.

103
0:05:35,000000 --> 0:05:35,990000
It was a normal process.

104
0:05:38,000000 --> 0:05:38,990000
We were not allowed to be Turks.

105
0:05:41,000000 --> 0:05:41,990000
They went to Turkey and they were treated there.

106
0:05:52,000000 --> 0:05:52,990000
The whole population that was in this district for a certain period of time was completely deprived of medical care. However, the picture is like this.

107
0:05:54,000000 --> 0:05:54,990000
One region is blocked, food and drinks are not provided to it,

108
0:06:00,000000 --> 0:06:00,990000
medical contacts are removed until they are taken to Turkey.

109
0:06:05,000000 --> 0:06:05,990000
This also explained the fact that initially some children did not want to go to Turkey because in some places,

110
0:06:10,000000 --> 0:06:10,990000
despite these actions, there was a real glut, a direct glut.

111
0:06:15,000000 --> 0:06:15,990000
The second good case that shows the atmosphere is one in which we met as younger people, as students.

112
0:06:23,000000 --> 0:06:23,990000
It is clear that when a person has contacts with students of different sexes,

113
0:06:27,000000 --> 0:06:27,990000
such pleasant things happen to us.

114
0:06:29,000000 --> 0:06:29,990000
But then at some point he decided to give us a coupon.

115
0:06:32,000000 --> 0:06:32,990000
He gave us a beer. Of course, it remained open.

116
0:06:35,000000 --> 0:06:35,990000
We went there and there was a box in front of the store.

117
0:06:39,000000 --> 0:06:39,990000
He said, who was the person, he said,

118
0:06:42,000000 --> 0:06:42,990000
I don't have a beer, but he said, what are you?

119
0:06:46,000000 --> 0:06:46,990000
We said, come on, now, father, just tell us so.

120
0:06:49,000000 --> 0:06:49,990000
We passed by and father said, there is beer,

121
0:06:52,000000 --> 0:06:52,990000
but there is no beer for the Turks,

122
0:06:54,000000 --> 0:06:54,990000
and you will come here later, why not?

123
0:06:57,000000 --> 0:06:57,990000
That is, there was, although we have not seen it publicly,

124
0:07:02,000000 --> 0:07:02,990000
there were obvious recommendations on this issue.

125
0:07:04,000000 --> 0:07:04,990000
What was the situation in the People were gathered in front of the Tudor embassy to spread some sort of pathological slogans.

126
0:07:29,000000 --> 0:07:29,990000
The comrade Odov Zhivkov expressed the important and fundamental issues of our foreign policy.

127
0:07:44,000000 --> 0:07:44,990000
The people of Sofia, the people of Sofia, the people of Sofia!

128
0:07:52,000000 --> 0:07:52,990000
What was known in Sofia was that these people wanted to be independent, to have autonomy, and they wanted to make us some kind of a burden on the Bulgarian state,

129
0:07:58,000000 --> 0:07:58,990000
and they wanted us to be expelled, so this was a very good policy of the previous government.

130
0:08:02,000000 --> 0:08:02,990000
But the high-ranking officials said that these were Bulgarians. They forgot their identity, we will return their names, we will restore them,

131
0:08:08,000000 --> 0:08:08,990000
so this was a serious process.

132
0:08:10,000000 --> 0:08:10,990000
On the other hand, nothing, which is very interesting,

133
0:08:12,000000 --> 0:08:12,990000
nobody cared about any logical connection here.

134
0:08:15,000000 --> 0:08:15,990000
It was said that this was a subordination,

135
0:08:17,000000 --> 0:08:17,990000
this was said at party meetings and at some more secret meetings,

136
0:08:21,000000 --> 0:08:21,990000
but the idea was that those who were there would spread it. These are Turks who have fallen under the influence of the Turkish government

137
0:08:29,000000 --> 0:08:29,990000
and their goal is to cut off part of Bulgaria.

138
0:08:33,000000 --> 0:08:33,990000
On the one hand, these are Bulgarians who have to settle,

139
0:08:36,000000 --> 0:08:36,990000
on the other hand, these are pure Turks who have a purpose to cut off part of Bulgaria.

140
0:08:39,000000 --> 0:08:39,990000
There was no conciliatory nature.

141
0:08:41,000000 --> 0:08:41,990000
The problem is that they always sought to steal from the local population, which would be acceptable.

142
0:08:48,000000 --> 0:08:48,990000
There were people who claimed that if they went to the markets and the people, they would mine for all possible problems, future ones, possibly,

143
0:09:06,000000 --> 0:09:06,990000
not to mention mines, and it was time for us to sort ourselves out,

144
0:09:10,000000 --> 0:09:10,990000
and then to re-settle ourselves with the real, from this attack, so to speak.

145
0:09:16,000000 --> 0:09:16,990000
So, that's how things were, and as I see, they are almost the same today.

146
0:09:31,000000 --> 0:09:31,990000
There are modifications, but the whole official establishment has been preserved. It has changed a bit, but that's how they are.

147
0:09:35,000000 --> 0:09:35,990000
These are my impressions.
