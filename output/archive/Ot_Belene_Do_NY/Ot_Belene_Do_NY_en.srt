1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
The story of the past

2
0:00:07,000000 --> 0:00:07,990000
Stories of past events, the power of the human spirit and the powerlessness of the system,

3
0:00:12,000000 --> 0:00:12,990000
freedom and its price.

4
0:00:14,000000 --> 0:00:14,990000
People have chosen the truth instead of lies.

5
0:00:17,000000 --> 0:00:17,990000
This is their story. The The story of Belene is not to be interrupted. Belene is part of the history of the people who were here and their loved ones.

6
0:01:07,000000 --> 0:01:07,990000
They think that they should go to the textbooks. I don't know if this part of the story is in the books.

7
0:01:19,000000 --> 0:01:19,990000
For me, Belene is a monument with a lot of pain.

8
0:01:29,000000 --> 0:01:29,990000
Even now, when I look at the pontoon, I can see these two trucks, like a bulldozers, driving the concentration camp. At that moment I was stuck in the pit.

9
0:01:45,000000 --> 0:01:45,990000
Even at that age, this pit always appears. Thank you. I was born on June 16, 1945.

10
0:02:37,000000 --> 0:02:37,990000
My parents were anarchists.

11
0:02:41,000000 --> 0:02:41,990000
My father was an anarchist for faith,

12
0:02:44,000000 --> 0:02:44,990000
and my mother was an anarchist by love.

13
0:02:47,000000 --> 0:02:47,990000
I was born in Radomir, and actually I spent my whole life in Pernik, I consider myself a Pernikian.

14
0:02:57,000000 --> 0:02:57,990000
My father was arrested in April 1945 and sent to the concentration camp in Dupnica in April 1945.

15
0:03:06,000000 --> 0:03:06,990000
My mother is in her seventh month of life, I am still not born.

16
0:03:11,000000 --> 0:03:11,990000
Even in the family archives there is a letter from my mother,

17
0:03:15,000000 --> 0:03:15,990000
in which she covers the entire mahala and collects signatures of almost all 38 people,

18
0:03:21,000000 --> 0:03:21,990000
who sign a characteristic that my he is a very good man, he does social things in the neighborhood.

19
0:03:30,000000 --> 0:03:30,990000
On May 23, my father was released somewhere about two or three weeks before I was born. After that, my life went on in Pernik, my family, my father is at home, he works, he started working at the Krystal factory. a political prisoner during the anti-fascist monarchy

20
0:04:09,000000 --> 0:04:09,990000
and he was elected by the workers of the plant Crystal

21
0:04:14,000000 --> 0:04:14,990000
as the professional union secretary of the plant.

22
0:04:17,000000 --> 0:04:17,990000
Years later, with the director's order, he was released

23
0:04:23,000000 --> 0:04:23,990000
and on the release document it says that he is released because he is a enemy of the people.

24
0:04:32,000000 --> 0:04:32,990000
I don't remember those years, I've only heard them from my brother, when his students in the pro-gymnasium classes were chasing him through the corridors and crucifying the sons of the enemies of the people.

25
0:04:51,000000 --> 0:04:51,990000
I have often wondered how this mechanism worked.

26
0:04:55,000000 --> 0:04:55,990000
They are not children who understand what the enemy of the people means.

27
0:05:02,000000 --> 0:05:02,990000
Neither those who crucify nor those for whom they are crucified.

28
0:05:06,300000 --> 0:05:08,700000
They don't know what the enemy of the people means.

29
0:05:10,100000 --> 0:05:24,800000
In 1948, when the 5th Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the militia began mass arrests.

30
0:05:25,000000 --> 0:05:25,990000
The militia started mass arrests. My father and I were arrested.

31
0:05:29,000000 --> 0:05:29,990000
He went to various concentration camps.

32
0:05:34,000000 --> 0:05:34,990000
He went to Kotsyan, Bogdanov Dolgo,

33
0:05:38,000000 --> 0:05:38,990000
where he made tuxedoes,

34
0:05:41,000000 --> 0:05:41,990000
from Bogdanov Dolgo to Minieral Nikolaev Kazalnashko.

35
0:05:47,000000 --> 0:05:47,990000
My father wrote a complaint to the administration.

36
0:05:51,000000 --> 0:05:51,990000
The conditions in the camp are unbearable.

37
0:05:54,000000 --> 0:05:54,990000
The food is very bad, there are clothes.

38
0:05:58,000000 --> 0:05:58,990000
They deposit this letter to the administration.

39
0:06:01,000000 --> 0:06:01,990000
Immediately the administration takes measures and decides to send him to Belene.

40
0:06:11,000000 --> 0:06:11,990000
And since 1949 my father has been in Belene.

41
0:06:16,000000 --> 0:06:16,990000
We received cards, letters, I remember those words.

42
0:06:21,000000 --> 0:06:21,990000
Vanceti, bravo, I understood that you have learned to read. Congratulations!

43
0:06:26,000000 --> 0:06:26,990000
And I told my father that I had broken my handwriting.

44
0:06:30,000000 --> 0:06:30,990000
The letter he wrote to me had a very broken handwriting.

45
0:06:34,000000 --> 0:06:34,990000
I told him to take measures and improve his handwriting.

46
0:06:37,000000 --> 0:06:37,990000
Find the book of Senkevich, Stas and Neri, and read it to me. Throughout this time, two years or more, I have been looking at my father's portrait in the hall,

47
0:06:52,000000 --> 0:06:52,990000
I have been touching it with my finger.

48
0:06:56,000000 --> 0:06:56,990000
When will I go to see my father?

49
0:06:59,000000 --> 0:06:59,990000
It will be done. It worked! We traveled from Pernik to Sofia.

50
0:07:06,000000 --> 0:07:06,990000
We took the train for Belene.

51
0:07:10,000000 --> 0:07:10,990000
We got off at night on this train and went to the school,

52
0:07:16,000000 --> 0:07:16,990000
where we were going to finish this night, sleeping in the school somewhere,

53
0:07:20,000000 --> 0:07:20,990000
on the floor. and we were waiting for the next morning at a place where the pontoon bridge was visible.

54
0:07:31,000000 --> 0:07:31,990000
At one point we saw two trucks from the position we were in,

55
0:07:38,000000 --> 0:07:38,990000
but they looked like two small cranes moving one after the other, passed through the pontoon bridge and the truck drivers jumped up.

56
0:07:58,000000 --> 0:07:58,990000
They started to look around, to look for the people, to look for the people with the right eyes.

57
0:08:05,000000 --> 0:08:05,990000
My father was a blacksmith.

58
0:08:08,000000 --> 0:08:08,990000
The moment I saw him, I was surprised.

59
0:08:11,000000 --> 0:08:11,990000
I was waiting for that moment and I couldn't recognize him.

60
0:08:18,000000 --> 0:08:18,990000
I recognized him when he grabbed me by the armpits and threw me into the air, I saw his smile.

61
0:08:27,000000 --> 0:08:27,990000
The meeting was at 2-2.30 am.

62
0:08:32,000000 --> 0:08:32,990000
I was wondering where people called me, where I went to see someone.

63
0:08:37,000000 --> 0:08:37,990000
Many of those who called me, called me.

64
0:08:40,000000 --> 0:08:40,990000
I asked myself why everyone loves me so much.

65
0:08:46,000000 --> 0:08:46,990000
And then someone said that I have a son like you, but I can't see him.

66
0:08:52,000000 --> 0:08:52,990000
Then I felt a little like a hero.

67
0:08:55,000000 --> 0:08:55,990000
All the gals, all my favorite sons, all of them.

68
0:09:00,000000 --> 0:09:00,990000
My father came out of prison almost He had many diseases, malaria.

69
0:09:07,000000 --> 0:09:07,990000
I remember the day he arrived without informing us. My mother was sewing on the machine.

70
0:09:16,000000 --> 0:09:16,990000
We were so surprised, especially my mother, that the sewing machine was so old, it was very strong.

71
0:09:25,000000 --> 0:09:25,990000
Suddenly it broke down, without the need for a foot, between the wheel and broke down.

72
0:09:33,000000 --> 0:09:33,990000
Some years started in search of a job.

73
0:09:40,000000 --> 0:09:40,990000
He was working, he was changing his job, and we were studying with my brother.

74
0:09:47,000000 --> 0:09:47,990000
Progymnasium, gymnasium.

75
0:09:50,000000 --> 0:09:50,990000
It was time to apply.

76
0:09:57,000000 --> 0:09:57,990000
But they did not allow us to apply for the student exams.

77
0:10:02,000000 --> 0:10:02,990000
You had to apply for the characteristic to all the documents.

78
0:10:06,000000 --> 0:10:06,990000
For me and my brother, this characteristic was written by the district office.

79
0:10:12,000000 --> 0:10:12,990000
My father told me, there is something wrong with this whole story,

80
0:10:17,000000 --> 0:10:17,990000
he took the characteristics, opened the enemy of the people.

81
0:10:25,000000 --> 0:10:25,990000
It doesn't matter that my brother Vasile is a great man, that Vanceti is very hardworking, that he is a great man.

82
0:10:35,000000 --> 0:10:35,990000
My father was very rich.

83
0:10:38,000000 --> 0:10:38,990000
A few houses below lived an active fighter against fascism, Chicho Stoiancho.

84
0:10:46,000000 --> 0:10:46,990000
He was a very honest man.

85
0:10:52,000000 --> 0:10:52,990000
He valued and respected my father very much.

86
0:10:58,000000 --> 0:10:58,990000
He was a Marxist, my father, an anarchist, and he said, my children don't want to study, and his children want to study,

87
0:11:12,000000 --> 0:11:12,990000
why should they be bothered?

88
0:11:15,000000 --> 0:11:15,990000
They wrote down the characteristics, they printed them out in front of him and gave it to us. Then I managed to get into the candidate student exam and entered the VHTI, the chemical and technological institute.

89
0:11:36,000000 --> 0:11:36,990000
During this time my father was already in the most oncological hospital in Sofia, in Dervenitsa.

90
0:11:44,000000 --> 0:11:44,990000
He was ill with leukemia.

91
0:11:47,000000 --> 0:11:47,990000
My father passed away. He couldn't wait to see my engineering diploma.

92
0:11:54,000000 --> 0:11:54,990000
His funeral, as a person, colorful, famous in Pernik, gathered about 200-250 people. The and that's why they were talking about my father's grave.

93
0:12:44,000000 --> 0:12:44,990000
My father didn't talk about the years spent in the camps.

94
0:12:51,000000 --> 0:12:51,990000
Most of the time he spent in these camps was here in Belene.

95
0:12:56,000000 --> 0:12:56,990000
I learned details about life here, about this terrible hell,

96
0:13:00,000000 --> 0:13:00,990000
we call it hell because it was hell.

97
0:13:09,000000 --> 0:13:09,990000
Mainly from his friends, fellow soldiers who had spent many years in these camps, I understood about their lives. There is a cruel story here. The death of the anarchist Ivan Yondev, when the commander checked everyone what the property was.

98
0:13:20,000000 --> 0:13:20,990000
Some said anarchists, others said I am a. Yondev said, I am a man.

99
0:13:27,000000 --> 0:13:27,990000
The commander repeated, what are you? I am a man.

100
0:13:33,000000 --> 0:13:33,990000
They threw him an eye and one day they shot him,

101
0:13:39,000000 --> 0:13:39,990000
as if he had started running.

102
0:13:42,000000 --> 0:13:42,990000
After his death, they said they had killed the man.

103
0:13:46,000000 --> 0:13:46,990000
They said the man was a full, definite member of the human race.

104
0:13:54,000000 --> 0:13:54,990000
This is Belene.

105
0:13:58,000000 --> 0:13:58,990000
So, years went on. I was assigned to work at the factory Crystal Pernik.

106
0:14:04,000000 --> 0:14:04,990000
I worked there for a year. There was a new barrel workshop.

107
0:14:08,000000 --> 0:14:08,990000
I worked for 12 hours, or even more.

108
0:14:12,000000 --> 0:14:12,990000
I didn't think about a scientific career, but I received a message from my boss about my diploma.

109
0:14:21,000000 --> 0:14:21,990000
I went to the second or third year of my studies, and my mother told me that there was a prize for me. I went to the city council, where the meeting was scheduled.

110
0:14:47,000000 --> 0:14:47,990000
I went to the gatekeeper and explained to him exactly who I am and what I am for.

111
0:14:56,000000 --> 0:14:56,990000
Behind me I heard a voice saying,

112
0:14:58,000000 --> 0:14:58,990000
''Come with me, I am Major Bozhilov from the State Security.

113
0:15:11,000000 --> 0:15:11,990000
There was a machine in your factory, a glass cutting machine.

114
0:15:16,000000 --> 0:15:16,990000
This machine costs 100,000 dollars.

115
0:15:24,000000 --> 0:15:24,990000
And nobody knows why the it's not integrated. Help us! I heard this word very often afterwards. Help us! He knows that they were instigating some fear in every person.

116
0:15:48,000000 --> 0:15:48,990000
And in me too. I was afraid to give up on the right.

117
0:15:54,000000 --> 0:15:54,990000
I saw this machine because it was not integrated into production. It turned out that the machine can cut glass, flat glass, with a wave density of 3%.

118
0:16:11,000000 --> 0:16:11,990000
Each machine has its own device to measure it.

119
0:16:14,000000 --> 0:16:14,990000
And the glass in the Crystal factory had a wave density of over 3%.

120
0:16:21,000000 --> 0:16:21,990000
I told them the things. Okay, okay, friend Vasilev.

121
0:16:26,000000 --> 0:16:26,990000
And now we want to set another task for you.

122
0:16:34,000000 --> 0:16:34,990000
Evangelists live against this.

123
0:16:37,000000 --> 0:16:37,990000
We want to know when they meet,

124
0:16:41,000000 --> 0:16:41,990000
who they are, how many they are,

125
0:16:44,000000 --> 0:16:44,990000
details. They meet every day. What are they? How many are there? Details.

126
0:16:46,000000 --> 0:16:46,990000
You want me to be a guide.

127
0:16:48,000000 --> 0:16:48,990000
You won't be.

128
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
And I thought I was wrong.

129
0:16:52,000000 --> 0:16:52,990000
I changed several jobs.

130
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
Electricity factory.

131
0:16:56,000000 --> 0:16:56,990000
Electricity factory in Zhabljano.

132
0:16:58,000000 --> 0:16:58,990000
Electricity factory in Zhabljano.

133
0:17:00,000000 --> 0:17:00,990000
And...

134
0:17:02,000000 --> 0:17:02,990000
a competition was opened

135
0:17:04,000000 --> 0:17:04,990000
in a group of employee in my field.

136
0:17:08,000000 --> 0:17:08,990000
I gave the documents.

137
0:17:10,000000 --> 0:17:10,990000
And from the bank there was no result, no call, no letter.

138
0:17:17,000000 --> 0:17:17,990000
I called and asked what was happening with the competition? You have your documents in the Pernick's police station.

139
0:17:25,000000 --> 0:17:25,990000
Wait, I say, what? What are my documents doing?

140
0:17:29,000000 --> 0:17:29,990000
A graduate student working in...

141
0:17:32,000000 --> 0:17:32,990000
I don't believe it!

142
0:17:34,000000 --> 0:17:34,990000
No!

143
0:17:35,000000 --> 0:17:35,990000
Bozhilo, already a major or a lieutenant colonel.

144
0:17:38,000000 --> 0:17:38,990000
And for the third time we come to offer you...

145
0:17:41,000000 --> 0:17:41,990000
You don't take the hand!

146
0:17:43,000000 --> 0:17:43,990000
Thank you, I refuse the competition.

147
0:17:47,000000 --> 0:17:47,990000
But at the same time I thought about independence.

148
0:17:50,000000 --> 0:17:50,990000
What was the possibility during socialism?

149
0:17:53,000000 --> 0:17:53,990000
Just one thing – farming, animal husbandry.

150
0:17:56,000000 --> 0:17:56,990000
I bought animals, pigs, mothers and looked at the pig.

151
0:18:00,000000 --> 0:18:00,990000
Even the first two mothers got their asses kicked here,

152
0:18:03,000000 --> 0:18:03,990000
because they weren't ready for the promise.

153
0:18:05,000000 --> 0:18:05,990000
Horrible! The girls came again.

154
0:18:08,000000 --> 0:18:08,990000
They told me, we are coming here because you are a very bad example.

155
0:18:12,000000 --> 0:18:12,990000
You are an engineer, from everywhere they say that you are very capable, that you are hardworking, but you have become a pig.

156
0:18:18,000000 --> 0:18:18,990000
I say well, but pig-working is work.

157
0:18:21,000000 --> 0:18:21,990000
I work. Yes, that's right, but there are others who work. And you are not for this work.

158
0:18:27,000000 --> 0:18:27,990000
They forced me, they paid me. I said no. They said, be careful, we do not answer what will happen to you. When my first meetings with the state security started,

159
0:18:50,000000 --> 0:18:50,990000
the memories of all those honslaggerists began to flow.

160
0:18:56,000000 --> 0:18:56,990000
I went to the people I had forgotten to repeat them to me.

161
0:19:00,000000 --> 0:19:00,990000
I went to some of them for the third or fourth time.

162
0:19:02,000000 --> 0:19:02,990000
I recorded them.

163
0:19:08,000000 --> 0:19:08,990000
In the barracks, in the end, two vases are placed, which are called winter vases. They are mugs. In fact, they are not mugs, but inside there is paper, or cotton, or cotton to keep warm during the winter.

164
0:19:16,000000 --> 0:19:16,990000
These two vases, on both sides, I was interested if someone had written it or not.

165
0:19:31,000000 --> 0:19:31,990000
This was the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s. No one had written.

166
0:19:37,000000 --> 0:19:37,990000
So I finished the book, I referred it to Georgi Markov, and he wrote down, he himself had given it.

167
0:19:46,000000 --> 0:19:46,990000
I had this intention, like in the Soviet Union, and in Europe, in the social countries, but frankly speaking, I was afraid to publish it, I was afraid to keep it in prison.

168
0:20:06,000000 --> 0:20:06,990000
So I chose the second option, to run away.

169
0:20:10,000000 --> 0:20:10,990000
And my mother, who was my first reader, said,

170
0:20:15,000000 --> 0:20:15,990000
son, I once stole it with your father in prison,

171
0:20:21,000000 --> 0:20:21,990000
I can't steal it with you, I can't.

172
0:20:26,000000 --> 0:20:26,990000
And I also mentioned another option, another is to take a handkerchief and run away with it.

173
0:20:33,000000 --> 0:20:33,990000
Go son, run away.

174
0:20:36,000000 --> 0:20:36,990000
In 1988, I was finally allowed to go to the border, but not to the Cathedral.

175
0:20:46,000000 --> 0:20:46,990000
All these years I have studied, collected information on how these people change and go to change and how they enter.

176
0:20:57,000000 --> 0:20:57,990000
It turned out that there are 10 minutes that you can enter without a document. I left here.

177
0:21:06,680000 --> 0:21:14,120000
My mother had prepared a bouquet of health.

178
0:21:14,120000 --> 0:21:21,720000
She said, with God, you can see me.

179
0:21:21,720000 --> 0:21:28,800000
I gave it to him and left.

180
0:21:40,000000 --> 0:21:40,990000
We go to the place of the cathedral and there we sleep, everyone who finds a place to sleep.

181
0:21:46,000000 --> 0:21:46,990000
It started to rain.

182
0:21:48,000000 --> 0:21:48,990000
Wet.

183
0:21:50,000000 --> 0:21:50,990000
I divided the manuscript into two parts.

184
0:21:55,000000 --> 0:21:55,990000
I put them here with socks for wide sleeves.

185
0:22:01,000000 --> 0:22:01,990000
The paper got wet. And I waited for it to get wet.

186
0:22:09,000000 --> 0:22:09,990000
The doors were opened, people were yelling, the state security, the police couldn't control the process.

187
0:22:17,000000 --> 0:22:17,990000
I managed to get in, and I brought money for dollars to continue, because I was leaving.

188
0:22:27,500000 --> 0:22:28,500000
I was leaving.

189
0:22:28,500000 --> 0:22:34,500000
I managed to get caught with that money and the manuscript.

190
0:22:34,500000 --> 0:22:38,500000
I went straight into the prison.

191
0:22:38,500000 --> 0:22:44,500000
I was watching, I was standing, I was trembling, I was deciding, but at 2 o'clock I was leaving.

192
0:22:44,500000 --> 0:22:45
They were scattered. I was trembling, I decided, and at exactly two o'clock I left.

193
0:22:49,000000 --> 0:22:49,990000
They were scattered, almost never stopped.

194
0:22:53,000000 --> 0:22:53,990000
The border...

195
0:22:57,000000 --> 0:22:57,990000
Down, down, down, Busilov city.

196
0:23:00,000000 --> 0:23:00,990000
I took the bus.

197
0:23:03,000000 --> 0:23:03,990000
Nis. Belgrade.

198
0:23:04,000000 --> 0:23:04,990000
Zagreb. I went down to the hill. I went to the cemetery of the town.

199
0:23:13,000000 --> 0:23:13,990000
It was around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I had only seen the map.

200
0:23:27,000000 --> 0:23:27,990000
I didn't expect to reach the crossing so quickly.

201
0:23:31,000000 --> 0:23:31,990000
I went to the border and started waiting.

202
0:23:35,000000 --> 0:23:35,990000
I started to pause the train many meters it was, 50-100 meters.

203
0:23:48,500000 --> 0:23:53
I could see everything. I was crawling, crawling, crawling.

204
0:23:53,000000 --> 0:23:53,990000
I felt my knees sweating, that was the limit speed.

205
0:23:58,000000 --> 0:23:58,990000
I got off the road for 30, I don't know how much, 3-4 km.

206
0:24:05,000000 --> 0:24:05,990000
I was drinking.

207
0:24:07,000000 --> 0:24:07,990000
I was drinking with delight.

208
0:24:09,000000 --> 0:24:09,990000
And at one point I heard the brakes of a police car and I saw the light.

209
0:24:15,000000 --> 0:24:15,990000
The hands of the car.

210
0:24:18,000000 --> 0:24:18,990000
From above.

211
0:24:21,000000 --> 0:24:21,990000
We stole one night of my mother in a tourist villa.

212
0:24:25,000000 --> 0:24:25,990000
We confiscated it.

213
0:24:27,000000 --> 0:24:27,990000
They took it, they took me to the villa in Pishina and from there things started.

214
0:24:32,000000 --> 0:24:32,990000
I stayed in Italy for two years sunny. I left for New York.

215
0:24:48,000000 --> 0:24:48,990000
It was between Christmas and New Year.

216
0:25:08,000000 --> 0:25:08,990000
The book went to New York, returned to Bulgaria. In fact, I sometimes get ironic.

217
0:25:11,000000 --> 0:25:11,990000
This is the book that made a world tour across the ocean.

218
0:25:15,000000 --> 0:25:15,990000
It was returned twice to be published in its native place. The first time a Spanish philosopher.

219
0:25:47,000000 --> 0:25:47,990000
He said that a nation that doesn't know its history, doesn't expect anything good.

220
0:25:53,000000 --> 0:25:53,990000
I'm not quoting exactly, but it's said so.

221
0:25:57,000000 --> 0:25:57,990000
He quoted a patterned phrase, but people learn from history, so they don't repeat their mistakes.

222
0:26:06,000000 --> 0:26:06,990000
And because I lived in two different worlds, here in the socialist world, of print, for freedom of the individual,

223
0:26:27,000000 --> 0:26:27,990000
you have to fight every day, from morning to evening.

224
0:26:31,000000 --> 0:26:31,990000
Every day. Every day. Thank you.
