1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
Welcome to the past unfinished.

2
0:00:04,000000 --> 0:00:04,990000
Welcome to this journey to the past, which explains many things from the present.

3
0:00:11,000000 --> 0:00:11,990000
Especially in these days, in which there are big disputes about whether one or the other party should be registered.

4
0:00:19,000000 --> 0:00:19,990000
Who represents the youth? Is there a youth? Should else who represents the youth?

5
0:00:25,000000 --> 0:00:25,990000
That's why we decided to remind the team of BIET two episodes from the beginning of the show.

6
0:00:34,000000 --> 0:00:34,990000
Two conversations that you will hear now, together with Mikhail Ivanov, one of the people who, to the greatest extent, protected the rights of the Bulgarian Muslims,

7
0:00:51,000000 --> 0:00:51,990000
when the communist regime took their names. There are many things about the genesis of the Movement for Rights and Freedom, the connection of the then official BKP and the unofficial state security for the creation of this organization, They will play with us. Let's look at it together, let's think about it

8
0:01:26,000000 --> 0:01:26,990000
and let's say

9
0:01:28,000000 --> 0:01:28,990000
that we don't want

10
0:01:30,000000 --> 0:01:30,990000
to be more participants

11
0:01:32,000000 --> 0:01:32,990000
in this lie.

12
0:01:34,000000 --> 0:01:34,990000
Enjoy watching! Democracy! Democracy! I don't know.

13
0:02:20,000000 --> 0:02:20,990000
Why did he want to lock you up?

14
0:02:25,000000 --> 0:02:25,990000
I don't know. He didn't want to leave the name. I'm sure of it.

15
0:02:27,000000 --> 0:02:27,990000
Did he do anything wrong?

16
0:02:29,000000 --> 0:02:29,990000
No, he didn't do anything wrong.

17
0:02:36,000000 --> 0:02:36,990000
How long have you been in prison?

18
0:02:38,000000 --> 0:02:38,990000
Four years.

19
0:02:40,000000 --> 0:02:40,990000
Where are you from?

20
0:02:42,000000 --> 0:02:42,990000
From Penkovski.

21
0:02:43,000000 --> 0:02:43,990000
What's your name?

22
0:02:44,000000 --> 0:02:44,990000
Rosen. Rosen? Whose? Svev andski. What's your name? Rosen.

23
0:02:45,000000 --> 0:02:45,990000
Rosen? Whose?

24
0:02:46,000000 --> 0:02:46,990000
Sviby Lev.

25
0:02:47,000000 --> 0:02:47,990000
And your father?

26
0:02:49,000000 --> 0:02:49,990000
Sviby Mitkov Lev.

27
0:02:53,000000 --> 0:02:53,990000
What's his real name?

28
0:02:55,000000 --> 0:02:55,990000
Salim Salim... Salim Salim.

29
0:03:00,000000 --> 0:03:00,990000
Which prison did your father go to?

30
0:03:02,000000 --> 0:03:02,990000
An old one.

31
0:03:03,000000 --> 0:03:03,990000
Have you seen him recently?

32
0:03:05,000000 --> 0:03:05,990000
No, recently. Five or six months ago.

33
0:03:10,000000 --> 0:03:10,990000
He's always on the run, right?

34
0:03:12,000000 --> 0:03:12,990000
No. The last episode of the show was shown in the last lecture. The colleagues from the information website Factor managed to

35
0:03:29,000000 --> 0:03:29,990000
find the information about the I have these footage from the last lecture.

36
0:03:52,000000 --> 0:03:52,990000
The colleagues from the information website Faktor managed to find the little Rossin,

37
0:03:58,000000 --> 0:03:58,990000
who is now called Reza.

38
0:04:04,000000 --> 0:04:04,990000
He lives in Istanbul. We also found his father. And in Faktor, an interesting story was published about the fact that the little Rosen had waited for his father until August 1990, when Ahmed Dogan was released, together with other people from the prison, after the fall of the communist regime,

39
0:04:33,000000 --> 0:04:33,990000
and August, when Rosen's father, Reza, was released from prison, together with many other political prisoners, who were in prison because their names were not registered.

40
0:04:46,000000 --> 0:04:46,990000
That is why I want to talk today with my guest, Mikhail Ivanov.

41
0:04:53,000000 --> 0:04:53,990000
Welcome.

42
0:04:54,000000 --> 0:04:54,990000
Thank you.

43
0:04:55,000000 --> 0:04:55,990000
Mikhail Ivanov was the return of the names of the

44
0:05:08,400000 --> 0:05:15,800000
Preservation of Rights and Freedoms and the most important interaction between the Bulgarians and the

45
0:05:15,800000 --> 0:05:32
Turks from the Bulgarian origin or the Bulgarians from the Turkish origin and the Mitsilomani. He tried to put down the tension that was created by certain circles in the former Communist Party.

46
0:05:32,000000 --> 0:05:32,990000
Later he was also a counselor on the ethnic issues of the president, Zhelev. You were very involved in all these events. Do you have any explanation why your father left in August and Dugan left in late December? I will tell you what I think, but first a little about the company, which has been representing me for a long time.

47
0:06:10,000000 --> 0:06:10,990000
Our committee was really one...

48
0:06:13,000000 --> 0:06:13,990000
We were established on the same day together with the Union of Democratic Forces on December 7.

49
0:06:20,000000 --> 0:06:20,990000
The committee included Bulgarians, Turks, Roma, Jews, Muslims, Christians in the committee.

50
0:06:29,000000 --> 0:06:29,990000
We were a multicultural community, not just multicultural, but a community where we all understood each other,

51
0:06:37,000000 --> 0:06:37,990000
we all sought common solutions, that is, we were together, interacting with each other. We were completely non-governmental organization, because we did not register.

52
0:06:50,000000 --> 0:06:50,990000
We collected the money in a shoe box when we had meetings.

53
0:06:55,000000 --> 0:06:55,990000
We did not have a chairman, I am not a chairman, but we had three speakers â€“

54
0:07:02,000000 --> 0:07:02,990000
Baiso Lehmann Gavazov, Antonina Zhelyazkova and me.

55
0:07:05,500000 --> 0:07:13,500000
I played the role of the secretary, I was the one who ran the office of our organization.

56
0:07:13,500000 --> 0:07:14,500000
Do you want to say something?

57
0:07:14,500000 --> 0:07:16
Yes, go ahead.

58
0:07:16,000000 --> 0:07:16,990000
Do you want to say something?

59
0:07:18,000000 --> 0:07:18,990000
Last time we talked about the acceptance of the law on the return of the names.

60
0:07:26,000000 --> 0:07:26,990000
Since the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party decided to return the names on December 29, 1989,

61
0:07:34,000000 --> 0:07:34,990000
the law was passed in the National Assembly on March 5, 1990. On March 1st there was a short meeting with Antonina Zhelyazkova, Doncho Popazov and Meridoganov.

62
0:07:53,000000 --> 0:07:53,990000
You signed the law to accept the court cases, to have no court requests, any off-the-court proceedings.

63
0:08:05,000000 --> 0:08:05,990000
Let's take a look at this material and continue the conversation.

64
0:08:12,000000 --> 0:08:12,990000
This is a monument to the unknown warrior.

65
0:08:17,000000 --> 0:08:17,990000
Here is Godoncho.

66
0:08:19,000000 --> 0:08:19,990000
Vachizar Toshev.

67
0:08:21,000000 --> 0:08:21,990000
Vachizar Toshev, then the Crown Representative.

68
0:08:24,000000 --> 0:08:24,990000
Hristo Ganev. Hristo Ganev, Binka Zeljaskova.

69
0:08:52,000000 --> 0:08:52,990000
There was an accusation that if the names are returned, some autonomy will be obtained. These things have been in my mind for 25 years.

70
0:08:55,000000 --> 0:08:55,990000
Look what he writes on this post.

71
0:08:57,000000 --> 0:08:57,990000
Let's hear it. Today we have gathered to express our solidarity, our desire to be together and together to read the declaration in the name of the two organizations.

72
0:09:28,000000 --> 0:09:28,990000
In the name of the people.

73
0:09:33,000000 --> 0:09:33,990000
To the National Assembly!

74
0:09:35,000000 --> 0:09:35,990000
Joint declaration of the Committee for National Redemption and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. We, Bulgarian citizens, members of the Committee for National Reconciliation

75
0:09:47,000000 --> 0:09:47,990000
and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms,

76
0:09:50,000000 --> 0:09:50,990000
aware that the process of democratization is unthinkable,

77
0:09:54,000000 --> 0:09:54,990000
unequal in rights and freedoms,

78
0:09:57,000000 --> 0:09:57,990000
without active opposition to any discrimination

79
0:10:00,000000 --> 0:10:00,990000
of ethnic and religious basis,

80
0:10:03,000000 --> 0:10:03,990000
declare that we cannot stay indifferent that even after

81
0:10:07,000000 --> 0:10:07,990000
the 100 days of democratic transformation, we still have one of the basic human rights

82
0:10:14,000000 --> 0:10:14,990000
â€“ the right to free choice of name. We insist on the new law on names, the return of

83
0:10:21,000000 --> 0:10:21,990000
mother names to be the administrative order.

84
0:10:25,000000 --> 0:10:25,990000
We are concerned that even after the most compromised texts

85
0:10:30,000000 --> 0:10:30,990000
from the Penal Code, people in Trashetka remain

86
0:10:35,000000 --> 0:10:35,990000
condemned for their opposition to the unprincipled

87
0:10:40,000000 --> 0:10:40,990000
policy on the national issue. Good afternoon. Can you take a picture of us? Can you take a picture of us?

88
0:10:46,000000 --> 0:10:46,990000
Can you take a picture of us in our distance?

89
0:10:48,000000 --> 0:10:48,990000
Please. The What are you talking about? This, this.

90
0:11:41,000000 --> 0:11:41,990000
Let's see what we have. Who wants to go first?

91
0:11:43,000000 --> 0:11:43,990000
I will go first. We hope that the National Assembly, the national representatives that are in it, will

92
0:11:57,000000 --> 0:11:57,990000
relate to the problem of interethnic relations as a council of the national welfare. We rely

93
0:12:05,000000 --> 0:12:05,990000
will be treated as a problem of the interethnic, inter-social relations as a service of the Bulgarian nation. We will read about it.

94
0:12:09,000000 --> 0:12:09,990000
That's it, we give you these things.

95
0:12:13,000000 --> 0:12:13,990000
We believe that this procedure, judicial, which is suggested for the Bulgarian

96
0:12:19,000000 --> 0:12:19,990000
Mohamedans, will make it extremely difficult to say as it puts these people

97
0:12:24,000000 --> 0:12:24,990000
in an

98
0:12:25,000000 --> 0:12:25,990000
impossibility to restore or change their names.

99
0:12:30,000000 --> 0:12:30,990000
Now, Evgenia Senova-Hayvazova is called by passport,

100
0:12:35,000000 --> 0:12:35,990000
and I am named by my mother and father, and when I was born Zehriye

101
0:12:40,000000 --> 0:12:40,990000
Senova-Hayvazova. A name that is less dignified, sound and beautiful than Evgeniev's.

102
0:12:50,000000 --> 0:12:50,990000
I would like to thank you for coming to the National Assembly.

103
0:12:58,000000 --> 0:12:58,990000
It is a key part of the project.

104
0:13:25,000000 --> 0:13:25,990000
I can assure you that your proposals will be made in the honor of the National Assembly and it will be taken with the necessary seriousness, because these are are human.

105
0:13:33,000000 --> 0:13:33,990000
This was the Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly,

106
0:13:39,000000 --> 0:13:39,990000
Mr. or as they were called then, the friend Angel Dimitrov.

107
0:13:57,000000 --> 0:13:57,990000
Misho, I seeing these footage without sound, without comment, and seeing the behavior of the then Deputy Minister, the President of the National Assembly, I see that they are making a fuss, saying that they don't have time, but they will see what they will do.

108
0:14:06,000000 --> 0:14:06,990000
Ahmed Dogan, or Medi Doganov, is still silent. What exactly happened?

109
0:14:12,000000 --> 0:14:12,990000
How did the big liar become the law of acceptance as he wanted, as he insisted in the request of the General Declaration of the Committee for National Reign and the Movement for Rights and Freedom?

110
0:14:24,000000 --> 0:14:24,990000
of the Committee for National Reconciliation and Movement for Rights and Freedom. There is not much time, but I can say that this week, when we made this declaration,

111
0:14:31,000000 --> 0:14:31,990000
and even until Monday, was a thrilling week in my life.

112
0:14:36,000000 --> 0:14:36,990000
I would not say a passionate week, to be honest.

113
0:14:40,000000 --> 0:14:40,990000
Now it is difficult to understand what is going on in the younger generation.

114
0:14:48,000000 --> 0:14:48,990000
But when the law was being passed on the restoration of the names of our fellow citizens, whose names were changed,

115
0:14:58,000000 --> 0:14:58,990000
two very acute problems arose.

116
0:15:00,000000 --> 0:15:00,990000
One of the problems was whether the return of the names would be through an administrative or judicial procedure.

117
0:15:07,000000 --> 0:15:07,990000
Immediately after the 10th of November, with the participation of the communist regime,

118
0:15:16,000000 --> 0:15:16,990000
certain circles from it, were created quite well organized post-communist and nationalist organizations

119
0:15:25,000000 --> 0:15:25,990000
the UN National Interest Protection Committee

120
0:15:28,000000 --> 0:15:28,990000
and the Rodolibian Union of the Red Cross, which was supposed to catch the refugees

121
0:15:32,000000 --> 0:15:32,990000
without any special influence among the refugees

122
0:15:34,000000 --> 0:15:34,990000
but they began to dictate and insisted that the refugees should be returned with a court procedure

123
0:15:40,000000 --> 0:15:40,990000
People said that they would not be taken with a court because they were taken with a fight and they should not to take them to court, because they were taken to court with a fight.

124
0:15:45,000000 --> 0:15:45,990000
They are not going to return them to court. We want them to return to the administration and we will return their names.

125
0:15:50,000000 --> 0:15:50,990000
This was the first question. The second question was that suddenly someone decided, and they decided again,

126
0:15:56,000000 --> 0:15:56,990000
that all the names of Bulgarian citizens should be finished with an F.

127
0:16:02,000000 --> 0:16:02,990000
For example, Kevorkianov, or Wagenstein, or Doganov.

128
0:16:08,000000 --> 0:16:08,990000
Our Committee for National Development was categorically against this.

129
0:16:12,000000 --> 0:16:12,990000
I came out with a short declaration in Vestnik Demokracija,

130
0:16:20,000000 --> 0:16:20,990000
where I made a decisive go against this manipulation. But unfortunately things did not go as planned.

131
0:16:27,500000 --> 0:16:31,500000
We still managed to win in the legislative commission

132
0:16:31,500000 --> 0:16:36,500000
that at least the names of the Turks would be changed

133
0:16:36,500000 --> 0:16:38,500000
according to the administrative procedure,

134
0:16:38,500000 --> 0:16:40,500000
but the Plumacians remained and the division was achieved.

135
0:16:40,500000 --> 0:16:44,500000
We continued to insist on the Plumacians

136
0:16:44,500000 --> 0:16:46
to be the administrative procedure. flames to be administrative procedures.

137
0:16:46,000000 --> 0:16:46,990000
Now, what happens if you allow me?

138
0:16:49,000000 --> 0:16:49,990000
Well...

139
0:16:51,000000 --> 0:16:51,990000
Now let's see what the media does to Ganov.

140
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
Well, let's make a video of what happened three days after March 1st.

141
0:17:02,000000 --> 0:17:02,990000
Four. 3 days after March 1st, 4 days, when it turned out that the names will be returned to the law, but everything you are talking about is messed up and it doesn't turn out like that.

142
0:17:15,000000 --> 0:17:15,990000
Yes, but I want to tell you that what we will see on the screen course of these events, to hold a meeting, our committee for national reconciliation,

143
0:17:36,000000 --> 0:17:36,990000
and we decided to organize this meeting.

144
0:17:46,000000 --> 0:17:46,990000
We invited Mehdi Doganov, Ahmed Dogan, but he didn't come.

145
0:17:51,000000 --> 0:17:51,990000
We waited for him quite late in the evening in the house of Don Shvapazov.

146
0:17:55,000000 --> 0:17:55,990000
He didn't come, but it turned out, as we found out later, that the same evening,

147
0:18:00,000000 --> 0:18:00,990000
on the 1st of March, we will see maybe later, Ahmed Dogan agreed to enter into a conversation with these post-communist formations and agreed to a judicial procedure for all and with OFIF.

148
0:18:18,000000 --> 0:18:18,990000
Only he hides this from all, including the members of the movement.

149
0:18:25,000000 --> 0:18:25,990000
I want to say this. The next day, on March 1, a very serious scandal took place in the mosque.

150
0:18:31,000000 --> 0:18:31,990000
The first deputy chairman of the Halim Pasezhov movement asked him,

151
0:18:34,000000 --> 0:18:34,990000
who are you, in the name of whom you are taking these decisions and acting in this way.

152
0:18:39,000000 --> 0:18:39,990000
Ahmed Dogan Maltchim was the first to answer.

153
0:18:42,000000 --> 0:18:42,990000
Then we went to a meeting. On the one hand, this meeting

154
0:18:46,000000 --> 0:18:46,990000
was a very symbolic day for me,

155
0:18:49,000000 --> 0:18:49,990000
because then we went to the monument of Vasile Levski,

156
0:18:52,000000 --> 0:18:52,990000
a Bulgarian, a Roma, a Gypsy,

157
0:18:55,000000 --> 0:18:55,990000
a Turk, a Pumak, a Jew.

158
0:18:58,000000 --> 0:18:58,990000
You are talking about the one on March 1st?

159
0:19:00,000000 --> 0:19:00,990000
On March 1st, we gathered in front of the monument of Levski.

160
0:19:03,000000 --> 0:19:03,990000
After that, we went here to submit the corresponding declaration.

161
0:19:07,000000 --> 0:19:07,990000
It was the return. First the declaration was submitted, then the monument of Levski.

162
0:19:11,000000 --> 0:19:11,990000
Yes, but unfortunately the things were cancelled because this agreement was already in the hands.

163
0:19:19,000000 --> 0:19:19,990000
But more than that, it was approved by the committee, the members of the Muslim section of the Independent Society, and the Ahmed Dogan, who at that time no one knew him, the nationalistic organizations, Peter Mladenov, the president of the State Council,

164
0:19:49,000000 --> 0:19:49,990000
Andrey Lukanov, the prime minister, and Stanko Todor, the deputy prime minister, where this was already completely hidden.

165
0:19:55,000000 --> 0:19:55,990000
Then there was a very long conversation with Andrey Lukanov, when he called me. Let's skip the footage in which Lukanov uses Ahmed Dogan for alibi.

166
0:20:13,000000 --> 0:20:13,990000
And because he wasn't known and people outside didn't know who he was,

167
0:20:19,000000 --> 0:20:19,990000
they kicked him out of the National Assembly, where they have been advising, so that he can put the waiting outside for a fair decision

168
0:20:28,000000 --> 0:20:28,990000
and a fair voting of the Law on Names,

169
0:20:32,000000 --> 0:20:32,990000
as they were informed by you, probably by him,

170
0:20:36,000000 --> 0:20:36,990000
and by all those who were present at the voting of the Law,

171
0:20:40,000000 --> 0:20:40,990000
so that he can...

172
0:20:43,000000 --> 0:20:43,990000
And everyone expected that there would be no next session,

173
0:20:46,000000 --> 0:20:46,990000
there would be no OVF.

174
0:20:48,000000 --> 0:20:48,990000
No, no, no, Evgeni, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

175
0:20:50,000000 --> 0:20:50,990000
Yes, just to hear.

176
0:20:52,000000 --> 0:20:52,990000
The names of the people are being voted by the National Assembly.

177
0:20:56,000000 --> 0:20:56,990000
We congratulate everyone!

178
0:21:03,000000 --> 0:21:03,990000
We are all extremely satisfied. We leave the hall of the National Assembly accepts is in accordance with your wishes,

179
0:21:34,000000 --> 0:21:34,990000
in very short terms, with guarantees that will give a legal court and you yourself, the society itself,

180
0:21:50,000000 --> 0:21:50,990000
Without the court and you, the society, with a secret procedure, everyone can return the name and choose whatever they want.

181
0:21:53,000000 --> 0:21:53,990000
This will be in accordance with the law.

182
0:22:03,000000 --> 0:22:03,990000
Can I speak before the card is rolling? Hear the people say without a court, without a court, without a court.

183
0:22:07,000000 --> 0:22:07,990000
And hear the comment after that.

184
0:22:10,000000 --> 0:22:10,990000
There was no court, now there is.

185
0:22:15,000000 --> 0:22:15,990000
At the moment the text itself cannot be read.

186
0:22:18,000000 --> 0:22:18,990000
It is now added to the writing machine, but it is as it is.

187
0:22:22,000000 --> 0:22:22,990000
The little man did not write to me to point out. little man. I have to forgive him.

188
0:22:36,000000 --> 0:22:36,990000
Now, since they know what to do,

189
0:22:40,000000 --> 0:22:40,990000
they ask Medi Doganov or Ahmed Dogan,

190
0:22:44,000000 --> 0:22:44,990000
Medi Doganov, to Dogan, still Medi Doganov,

191
0:22:46,000000 --> 0:22:46,990000
to disperse them from the square.

192
0:22:49,000000 --> 0:22:49,990000
But they tried to tell me to do it.

193
0:22:52,000000 --> 0:22:52,990000
Ladies and gentlemen,

194
0:22:54,000000 --> 0:22:54,990000
attention please!

195
0:22:56,000000 --> 0:22:56,990000
A little higher.

196
0:22:58,000000 --> 0:22:58,990000
Attention please!

197
0:23:02,000000 --> 0:23:02,990000
Ahmed Dogan speaking.

198
0:23:04,000000 --> 0:23:04,990000
We talked about this. At this moment he is legitimizing himself.

199
0:23:09,000000 --> 0:23:09,990000
Tomorrow the final text of the law will be published in the newspapers.

200
0:23:16,000000 --> 0:23:16,990000
We have the same project.

201
0:23:19,000000 --> 0:23:19,990000
I assure you that we will not be fooled, mock and there will be no suffering in relation to the name.

202
0:23:27,840000 --> 0:23:31,840000
Thank you for your attention and maybe

203
0:23:31,840000 --> 0:23:37,840000
the next day our first brothers will be taken and will be involved in this act.

204
0:23:37,840000 --> 0:23:45
Thank you for much! Thank you very much, Yasha!

205
0:23:45,000000 --> 0:23:45,990000
Yasha, you are a great man!

206
0:23:57,000000 --> 0:23:57,990000
Listen to what he says.

207
0:24:00,000000 --> 0:24:00,990000
What does it mean to be bad?

208
0:24:03,000000 --> 0:24:03,990000
This is the only second word second name? Only the second name remains. In the words of the one who created the movement of the Right and Liberation, Andrei Lukanov,

209
0:24:29,000000 --> 0:24:29,990000
how they lie again.

210
0:24:32,000000 --> 0:24:32,990000
Listen, people.

211
0:24:35,000000 --> 0:24:35,990000
We will not beg.

212
0:24:38,000000 --> 0:24:38,990000
We will beg.

213
0:24:41,000000 --> 0:24:41,990000
You understand?

214
0:24:43,000000 --> 0:24:43,990000
This is a statement of restoration of the... We beg you!

215
0:24:49,000000 --> 0:24:49,990000
What will be the procedure? The court will be held on the 14th of November.

216
0:24:55,000000 --> 0:24:55,990000
He will come to the place where there is a big meeting.

217
0:24:59,000000 --> 0:24:59,990000
People will talk.

218
0:25:26,000000 --> 0:25:26,990000
There is no such thing as a Ahmed Dogan. Ahmed Dogan. Yes, yes. He was on the bed, because we were...

219
0:25:28,000000 --> 0:25:28,990000
I'm sorry.

220
0:25:30,000000 --> 0:25:30,990000
I can't say anything.

221
0:25:32,000000 --> 0:25:32,990000
I'm sorry.

222
0:25:40,000000 --> 0:25:40,990000
It must be hard for you to watch these footage, right?

223
0:25:42,000000 --> 0:25:42,990000
Yes, because it was one of the biggest manipulations.

224
0:25:45,000000 --> 0:25:45,990000
Not only Ahmed Dogan was released on December 22,

225
0:25:49,000000 --> 0:25:49,990000
but on December 20, 1989,

226
0:25:52,000000 --> 0:25:52,990000
they released Kasim Dal, Nezhmedin Hak and others.

227
0:25:55,000000 --> 0:25:55,990000
But a large group of very tough fighters against the revolutionary process

228
0:25:59,000000 --> 0:25:59,990000
remained in prison before the entire organization

229
0:26:02,000000 --> 0:26:02,990000
was taken into custody.

230
0:26:04,000000 --> 0:26:04,990000
This was in connection with the answer to your first question.

231
0:26:06,000000 --> 0:26:06,990000
But here what is happening is, in fact...

232
0:26:11,000000 --> 0:26:11,990000
I can say one more thing.

233
0:26:13,000000 --> 0:26:13,990000
All night, several people are fighting inside the National Assembly,

234
0:26:16,000000 --> 0:26:16,990000
as some kind of working group,

235
0:26:18,000000 --> 0:26:18,990000
against these two things, the administrative procedure and the Office of the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council.

236
0:26:22,000000 --> 0:26:22,990000
We had Miroslav Darmov from our committee at the time, then he became a deputy from the DPS,

237
0:26:27,000000 --> 0:26:27,990000
Flamen Bulgoev, who was later a councillor for Zheliv and Parvanov,

238
0:26:31,000000 --> 0:26:31,990000
I'm sorry, Flamen, from Petar Stoyanov,

239
0:26:35,000000 --> 0:26:35,990000
Todor Batkov from the name of the National Front, the most famous one,

240
0:26:40,000000 --> 0:26:40,990000
Agent Tara.

241
0:26:41,000000 --> 0:26:41,990000
Please?

242
0:26:42,000000 --> 0:26:42,990000
Agent Tara.

243
0:26:43,000000 --> 0:26:43,990000
Exactly.

244
0:26:44,000000 --> 0:26:44,990000
Together with agent Sava. In fact, he was our opponent, a very serious opponent. We couldn't do anything through the night. Agent Tara. Please? Agent Tara. Exactly.

245
0:26:45,000000 --> 0:26:45,990000
Together with agent Sava.

246
0:26:46,000000 --> 0:26:46,990000
In fact, he was our opponent.

247
0:26:47,000000 --> 0:26:47,990000
A very serious opponent.

248
0:26:48,000000 --> 0:26:48,990000
We could not do anything in the name of the media.

249
0:26:50,000000 --> 0:26:50,990000
Medi Doganov was not a member of the media at all.

250
0:26:52,000000 --> 0:26:52,990000
He did not participate in this race at all.

251
0:26:54,000000 --> 0:26:54,990000
Okay, Misho, but all of this means that some people are released at the end of December,

252
0:27:00,000000 --> 0:27:00,990000
at the beginning of January, there is the movement for rights and freedoms is being made.

253
0:27:06,000000 --> 0:27:06,990000
There are elections.

254
0:27:09,000000 --> 0:27:09,990000
They enter the Great National Assembly with a large group of representatives.

255
0:27:14,000000 --> 0:27:14,990000
Before that, people have been lying that a good law without OF and EF was adopted.

256
0:27:20,000000 --> 0:27:20,990000
And after the national representatives have already been in their pre-election campaign,

257
0:27:24,500000 --> 0:27:30
And when they become representatives of the people, even in their election campaign, they use the idea that if they enter the parliament, they will remove the positions of the OV and the F,

258
0:27:30,000000 --> 0:27:30,990000
and that everything is done in such a way that the movement can be classified as a savior of the Bulgarian Turks

259
0:27:37,000000 --> 0:27:37,990000
or of this minority that was moderated by this Communist Party.

260
0:27:41,000000 --> 0:27:41,990000
Here I want to separate two things here. Many people who fought and deserved to be honest and honest with their lives came out of the prison.

261
0:27:51,000000 --> 0:27:51,990000
I can say the same about Halim Pesazhov, who was the first Deputy Chairman and Kasim Dal and many others.

262
0:27:57,000000 --> 0:27:57,990000
But the problem was that Ahmed Dogan quickly took over the situation and with the people he chose, he actually changed things.

263
0:28:08,000000 --> 0:28:08,990000
But the manipulation was very serious, because you heard what Ahmed Dogan said before everyone else,

264
0:28:14,000000 --> 0:28:14,990000
and then he went to them again, and his emissaries went and said,

265
0:28:18,000000 --> 0:28:18,990000
you will never return your names, we will enter the National Assembly, you will vote for us, and then, after we enter, we will change the law.

266
0:28:27,000000 --> 0:28:27,990000
That is, the issue of the OF-IF and the administrative procedure became a fundamental element of the pre-election propaganda

267
0:28:34,000000 --> 0:28:34,990000
and the Women for Rights and Freedom and brought them a very large asset, that is, increased their voters,

268
0:28:40,000000 --> 0:28:40,990000
in the opinion of the voters, I can say here quite specifically, and I am talking specifically about the Democratic Forces,

269
0:28:45,000000 --> 0:28:45,990000
Can I ask you to continue this conversation?

270
0:28:49,000000 --> 0:28:49,990000
Because the deception continues and I want to end with something.

271
0:28:55,000000 --> 0:28:55,990000
Please, let this one frame with the name DPS.

272
0:29:10,000000 --> 0:29:10,990000
I think it's one of the shortest in the list. Yes, you can shoot it. With the name DPS.

273
0:29:13,000000 --> 0:29:13,990000
You must know the name of your comrades.

274
0:29:16,000000 --> 0:29:16,990000
You must know the name of your officers.

275
0:29:19,000000 --> 0:29:19,990000
Traditions, results, etc.

276
0:29:21,000000 --> 0:29:21,990000
This is an activist of the Committee for National Reconciliation, Fein Menderes.

277
0:29:25,000000 --> 0:29:25,990000
This is one of the activists of the Committee, but these are my staff,

278
0:29:30,000000 --> 0:29:30,990000
which I have never allowed the DPS to use for their propaganda.

279
0:29:35,000000 --> 0:29:35,990000
This is Bayabdi. And in the next show I will show the origin of this,

280
0:29:42,000000 --> 0:29:42,990000
with which the Movement for Rights and was made by propaganda for so long.

281
0:29:48,000000 --> 0:29:48,990000
Because at this moment there is no movement for the right and freedom

282
0:29:52,000000 --> 0:29:52,990000
nor Ahmed Dogan has appeared in front of these people and looked them in the eyes.

283
0:29:56,000000 --> 0:29:56,990000
But the fact that they allowed themselves to make propaganda with stolen material

284
0:30:00,000000 --> 0:30:00,990000
I personally will not keep silent.

285
0:30:04,000000 --> 0:30:04,990000
But I will be happy next time to, because the topic is very big.

286
0:30:09,000000 --> 0:30:09,990000
Do you agree?

287
0:30:10,000000 --> 0:30:10,990000
Yes, I agree with pleasure.

288
0:30:12,000000 --> 0:30:12,990000
Both of us are participants in these events, but both of us feel obliged to tell them as they happened.

289
0:30:21,000000 --> 0:30:21,990000
Yes, I agree.

290
0:30:41,000000 --> 0:30:41,990000
A video I shot 26 years ago

291
0:30:48,000000 --> 0:30:48,990000
was used by the Movement for Rights and Co 26 years for election agitation, without my consent. It was marked with the DPS's signature and it was spread year after year, making propaganda for this party or movement. I would be surprised if this recording was not particularly valuable to me.

292
0:31:10,000000 --> 0:31:10,990000
The whole story of the theft was noted in the news site Faktor.bg. They reminded me of something I almost forgot.

293
0:31:26,000000 --> 0:31:26,990000
In 2001, a case was filed against me.

294
0:31:32,000000 --> 0:31:32,990000
The case was filed by Vesnik, except a camera and a video recorder.

295
0:31:54,000000 --> 0:31:54,990000
The door of the room was stabbed with a knife. The newspaper Kapital reminded me that two weeks before that I had given an interview for the newspaper 24 Hours

296
0:32:10,000000 --> 0:32:10,990000
which said that I was losing politics because of people like Biserov and Tzonev.

297
0:32:17,000000 --> 0:32:17,990000
The same people as Hristo Biserov and Rodan Tzonev who are in the movement for rights and freedoms.

298
0:32:22,000000 --> 0:32:22,990000
I don't want to make any speculations whether the tape was stolen or not, but I want to say that everyone should calm down.

299
0:32:32,000000 --> 0:32:32,990000
Even now, in my house, I don't keep any original copies. There were only copies, so the stolen copy is probably a stolen copy, made through records. I have no idea.

300
0:32:45,000000 --> 0:32:45,990000
But even now, if someone has the intention to repeat the event from 2001, I would like to say that there are no originals at home.

301
0:33:00,000000 --> 0:33:00,990000
They are kept in a safe place. and keep them safe. Now I want to show you part of the stolen material

302
0:33:09,000000 --> 0:33:09,990000
or the one that was used illegally.

303
0:33:12,000000 --> 0:33:12,990000
After that we will show you the original recording.

304
0:33:19,000000 --> 0:33:19,990000
The original is from an event that has never been shown.

305
0:33:24,000000 --> 0:33:24,990000
It is an event that has never been shown.

306
0:33:30,000000 --> 0:33:30,990000
The archives of the MEDRA must call the names of the victims. They when they know the truth, the Bulgarians will understand the meaning

307
0:33:46,000000 --> 0:33:46,990000
of their homeland.

308
0:33:48,000000 --> 0:33:48,990000
The revolution will come

309
0:33:50,000000 --> 0:33:50,990000
and will give them the support to defend us,

310
0:33:52,000000 --> 0:33:52,990000
to leave us tractors and trucks,

311
0:33:54,000000 --> 0:33:54,990000
to feed us cows and goats,

312
0:33:56,000000 --> 0:33:56,990000
to represent the real object.

313
0:33:58,000000 --> 0:33:58,990000
But the main goal

314
0:34:00,000000 --> 0:34:00,990000
is to save the Bulgarian world.

315
0:34:02,000000 --> 0:34:02,990000
Through its many paths,

316
0:34:04,000000 --> 0:34:04,990000
through its long and tragic journey, we will Through your many years of historical and political history,

317
0:34:06,000000 --> 0:34:06,990000
we have always been proud of you,

318
0:34:08,000000 --> 0:34:08,990000
the city of Sibov, and we respect you for your youth and security.

319
0:34:13,000000 --> 0:34:13,990000
For these events from December 28 and 29, 1989,

320
0:34:19,500000 --> 0:34:25
we started the conversation and the last time with Mikhail Ivanov.

321
0:34:25,000000 --> 0:34:25,990000
Welcome to the studio, Misho.

322
0:34:27,000000 --> 0:34:27,990000
Thank you.

323
0:34:29,000000 --> 0:34:29,990000
We started the conversation and showed some of the events

324
0:34:34,000000 --> 0:34:34,990000
regarding the adoption of the law on returning names in March 1990.

325
0:34:40,000000 --> 0:34:40,990000
But we only mentioned what happened in fact in 1929, when the names were restored.

326
0:34:49,000000 --> 0:34:49,990000
Misho, I would like to see it together. Do you agree?

327
0:34:53,000000 --> 0:34:53,990000
Of course. Where have you been?

328
0:34:55,000000 --> 0:34:55,990000
And then we will comment. Please, go ahead.

329
0:34:59,000000 --> 0:34:59,990000
The archives of Mevera must be called the names of the deceased.

330
0:35:03,000000 --> 0:35:03,990000
The whole truth about the traditions, traditions traditions, religious cults must be known.

331
0:35:09,000000 --> 0:35:09,990000
The forbidden to speak the language of the mother, the stupid and arrogant to the right ones,

332
0:35:13,000000 --> 0:35:13,990000
the abhorrence of the dead and the dead.

333
0:35:16,000000 --> 0:35:16,990000
Only when they know the truth, the Bulgarians will understand the suffering of their compatriots.

334
0:35:21,000000 --> 0:35:21,990000
Their peaceful protests, hunger strikes, demonstrations, which gave the situation with force and bloodshed,

335
0:35:30,000000 --> 0:35:30,990000
as well as the last mass murder of 300,000 of our citizens, who left their the illegal trucks and trucks, to remove the cities and towns, to destroy other military objects.

336
0:35:50,000000 --> 0:35:50,990000
The Nationalist is the only one who is loyal to the Bulgarian people.

337
0:35:54,000000 --> 0:35:54,990000
Through his many years of radical and tragic history, he has always promoted democracy,

338
0:35:59,000000 --> 0:35:59,990000
strong freedom and respect for youth and security, whose homeland is Bulgaria. It is clear that this Turkish and Polish anti-Bulgarian attitude towards hatred, nationalism, extremism.

339
0:36:27,000000 --> 0:36:27,990000
What should be done?

340
0:36:29,000000 --> 0:36:29,990000
It is necessary to make one.

341
0:36:31,000000 --> 0:36:31,990000
Bulgarians, Poles and Turks to shake hands.

342
0:36:34,000000 --> 0:36:34,990000
Let us get to know each other better, to understand each other, to try to forgive each other and to reconcile.

343
0:36:40,000000 --> 0:36:40,990000
And to everyone, as we call it in the Polish language, the right to a free choice of name, in the part of the Republic of Turkey, and to help us to have the right to a free and elected name.

344
0:36:47,000000 --> 0:36:47,990000
In the language of the Republic of Turkey.

345
0:36:49,000000 --> 0:36:49,990000
Bravo!

346
0:36:51,000000 --> 0:36:51,990000
Bravo!

347
0:36:53,000000 --> 0:36:53,990000
Bravo!

348
0:36:55,000000 --> 0:36:55,990000
Edisvog! Edisvog! Edisvog! EDITFORM! EDITFORM! EDITED! Edisbon! Edisbon! The We need! We you! We want to see you!

349
0:38:50,000000 --> 0:38:50,990000
We want to see you! Names of the country! The name of the country!

350
0:39:33,000000 --> 0:39:33,990000
May they be alive and healthy, may they return our names.

351
0:39:35,000000 --> 0:39:35,990000
May they meet our children for the New Year with the new names.

352
0:39:40,000000 --> 0:39:40,990000
Take a picture of us like brothers.

353
0:39:42,000000 --> 0:39:42,990000
Take a picture of us like brothers.

354
0:39:44,000000 --> 0:39:44,990000
Are you all or none? None. We are the 25th generation. We are the first generation. And they are still alive.

355
0:39:48,000000 --> 0:39:48,990000
They are still alive.

356
0:39:50,000000 --> 0:39:50,990000
Holy spirits.

357
0:39:52,000000 --> 0:39:52,990000
You have to melt the wood.

358
0:39:54,000000 --> 0:39:54,990000
The wood.

359
0:39:56,000000 --> 0:39:56,990000
Look at the war. Since when have you been here? Since yesterday.

360
0:40:06,000000 --> 0:40:06,990000
Since yesterday?

361
0:40:08,000000 --> 0:40:08,990000
Yes.

362
0:40:10,000000 --> 0:40:10,990000
Where did you sleep?

363
0:40:12,000000 --> 0:40:12,990000
On the street.

364
0:40:14,000000 --> 0:40:14,990000
All night?

365
0:40:16,000000 --> 0:40:16,990000
Yes.

366
0:40:18,000000 --> 0:40:18,990000
Everyone was dry.

367
0:40:20,000000 --> 0:40:20,990000
I was in my mother's bag.

368
0:40:22,000000 --> 0:40:22,990000
I was in my mother's bag.

369
0:40:24,000000 --> 0:40:24,990000
I was in my mother's bag. I was in my mother's bag. Where did you go? To the street. All night?

370
0:40:26,000000 --> 0:40:26,990000
Yes.

371
0:40:28,000000 --> 0:40:28,990000
Everyone was there.

372
0:40:30,000000 --> 0:40:30,990000
You left your jacket and mother there.

373
0:40:32,000000 --> 0:40:32,990000
You were there.

374
0:40:34,000000 --> 0:40:34,990000
Please, I can't feel anything.

375
0:40:36,000000 --> 0:40:36,990000
I'm dying. We are in the middle of the road. Long live the revolution!

376
0:41:08,000000 --> 0:41:08,990000
I'm here. I can't forget those eyes of Bayabdi. I saw them on March 5th, when the same people were lied to by Andrei Lukanov and Ahmed Dogan and Gino Ganev,

377
0:41:41,000000 --> 0:41:41,990000
that the law on returning names will be adopted, so that they could restore their names within a few months.

378
0:41:46,000000 --> 0:41:46,990000
They were lied to on this day, on the 29th.

379
0:41:52,000000 --> 0:41:52,990000
But they were lied to because after that it was said that

380
0:41:58,000000 --> 0:41:58,990000
the return of names was brought by the Movement for Justice and Freedom,

381
0:42:03,000000 --> 0:42:03,990000
but to this date there was no movements for rights and freedoms.

382
0:42:06,000000 --> 0:42:06,990000
There were people like Mikhail Ivanov, Antonina Zelaskova, hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians who were involved in the pain and suffering of those people, He was taken away from the name, it was forbidden to profess his religion.

383
0:42:27,000000 --> 0:42:27,990000
All human rights were violated.

384
0:42:32,000000 --> 0:42:32,990000
Misho, is there a need for a comment when you watch these footage?

385
0:42:38,000000 --> 0:42:38,990000
And what is your comment from today's point of view?

386
0:42:43,000000 --> 0:42:43,990000
I can't comment from today's point of view,

387
0:42:45,000000 --> 0:42:45,990000
because these shots have a great importance for me personally.

388
0:42:50,000000 --> 0:42:50,990000
In the beginning we saw Fim Menderes,

389
0:42:54,000000 --> 0:42:54,990000
who was a member of our Committee for National Reconciliation,

390
0:42:58,000000 --> 0:42:58,990000
and he read a new statement.

391
0:43:00,000000 --> 0:43:00,990000
This is the same declaration of our Committee,

392
0:43:02,000000 --> 0:43:02,990000
a remarkable declaration, of which I participated.

393
0:43:09,000000 --> 0:43:09,990000
If we have to go back to that moment,

394
0:43:15,000000 --> 0:43:15,990000
we have to express our admiration to those people,

395
0:43:19,000000 --> 0:43:19,990000
who, during three days and nights,

396
0:43:22,000000 --> 0:43:22,990000
at a temperature of minus 10 degrees Celsius.

397
0:43:25,000000 --> 0:43:25,990000
There was snow. The nature was kind to you when you were filming.

398
0:43:32,000000 --> 0:43:32,990000
But there was snow and they constantly walked around.

399
0:43:36,000000 --> 0:43:36,990000
And what I can also say about those days, you saw tea.

400
0:43:42,000000 --> 0:43:42,990000
Vili Tsekov, who was also a member of the committee, managed to inform the people of Sofia via Radio Sofia

401
0:43:49,000000 --> 0:43:49,990000
that everyone should bring whatever they can. Tea, snacks, cakes.

402
0:43:55,000000 --> 0:43:55,990000
And you saw it.

403
0:43:59,000000 --> 0:43:59,990000
Our physicists were making tea in their thermos in their institutes and they carried it.

404
0:44:06,000000 --> 0:44:06,990000
People made it themselves, but the women made cakes, cakes with salt and gave them to the people so they could keep the wells.

405
0:44:14,000000 --> 0:44:14,990000
This is not the case anymore, if I have to talk about it.

406
0:44:28,280000 --> 0:44:33,760000
This participation and solidarity should be the main flag of our society. In relation to each other, in relation to the different, in relation to...

407
0:44:33,760000 --> 0:44:50
And in understanding that we are one nation and we should make our Bulgaria better. The situation was so shocking with the frozen bread and the people I filmed for two days.

408
0:44:50,000000 --> 0:44:50,990000
I had just gone to buy some pancakes from the Shishman bakery and they announced that the decision has been made to return the names.

409
0:44:58,000000 --> 0:44:58,990000
I started filming with delay and I ask let's watch these footage.

410
0:45:06,000000 --> 0:45:06,990000
Democracy! Democracy!

411
0:45:10,000000 --> 0:45:10,990000
Democracy! Democracy!

412
0:45:14,000000 --> 0:45:14,990000
Democracy! Democracy!

413
0:45:18,000000 --> 0:45:18,990000
Democracy! Democracy!

414
0:45:22,000000 --> 0:45:22,990000
The EGC Party decided to return the names.

415
0:45:27,000000 --> 0:45:27,990000
But there is a big manipulation here that I want to comment on.

416
0:45:30,000000 --> 0:45:30,990000
A little bit lower.

417
0:45:31,000000 --> 0:45:31,990000
Look at the man with the white hair. He says he is Professor Ivan Angelov.

418
0:45:34,000000 --> 0:45:34,990000
On the right you see Konstantin Trenchev. Remember these two faces.

419
0:45:39,000000 --> 0:45:39,990000
And in the middle is Hasan Byalkov.

420
0:45:41,000000 --> 0:45:41,990000
In the middle is Hasan Byalkov, yes.

421
0:45:43,000000 --> 0:45:43,990000
How do we hear?

422
0:45:46,000000 --> 0:45:46,990000
Go to your homes peacefully and peacefully.

423
0:45:48,000000 --> 0:45:48,990000
Before you go, the news will be there.

424
0:45:52,000000 --> 0:45:52,990000
Bravo!

425
0:45:54,000000 --> 0:45:54,990000
Bravo!

426
0:45:56,000000 --> 0:45:56,990000
Bravo!

427
0:45:58,000000 --> 0:45:58,990000
Congratulations! Congratulations!

428
0:46:00,000000 --> 0:46:00,990000
Congratulations! Congratulations!

429
0:46:02,000000 --> 0:46:02,990000
Congratulations! Congratulations!

430
0:46:04,000000 --> 0:46:04,990000
Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Glory!

431
0:46:16,000000 --> 0:46:16,990000
This is YaldÄ±z Ibrahimova, the great Bulgarian singer YaldÄ±z Ibrahimova,

432
0:46:24,000000 --> 0:46:24,990000
before that she was nicknamed Susana Erova,

433
0:46:27,000000 --> 0:46:27,990000
she continues to come to Bulgaria, to hold concerts for her audience.

434
0:46:32,000000 --> 0:46:32,990000
She is also a member of our committee. Since then we have become close to her.

435
0:46:37,000000 --> 0:46:37,990000
Let's make a little effort.

436
0:46:40,000000 --> 0:46:40,990000
Glory to the Lord! Glory to the Lord! Glory to the Lord! Glory to the Lord!

437
0:46:45,000000 --> 0:46:45,990000
This is the greatest day of my life!

438
0:46:48,000000 --> 0:46:48,990000
The gift we bring to the children!

439
0:46:51,000000 --> 0:46:51,990000
The gift we bring to the children!

440
0:46:54,000000 --> 0:46:54,990000
To be alive and healthy, all of us to be together!

441
0:46:59,000000 --> 0:46:59,990000
There is no one who can make you happy more than this!

442
0:47:03,000000 --> 0:47:03,990000
There is no one to blame. Come on, there is no one to blame. Let's not talk about this.

443
0:47:06,000000 --> 0:47:06,990000
It's a 18 year old pain.

444
0:47:08,000000 --> 0:47:08,990000
Pain for 18 years.

445
0:47:10,000000 --> 0:47:10,990000
18 years of pain.

446
0:47:12,000000 --> 0:47:12,990000
We are going through 18 years.

447
0:47:16,000000 --> 0:47:16,990000
Pain for 18 years.

448
0:47:18,000000 --> 0:47:18,990000
It's already 40 something years.

449
0:47:22,000000 --> 0:47:22,990000
But then,

450
0:47:24,000000 --> 0:47:24,990000
these people were manipulated manipulation was done.

451
0:47:26,000000 --> 0:47:26,990000
You wanted to say...

452
0:47:28,000000 --> 0:47:28,990000
Yes, let me say a well-known comment.

453
0:47:30,000000 --> 0:47:30,990000
I think it is important.

454
0:47:32,000000 --> 0:47:32,990000
I want to finish my thought from what I started to talk about before.

455
0:47:36,000000 --> 0:47:36,990000
This idea, the idea to be together,

456
0:47:39,000000 --> 0:47:39,990000
what people called unity,

457
0:47:41,000000 --> 0:47:41,990000
to solve our problems together,

458
0:47:44,000000 --> 0:47:44,990000
was very well perceived in the society at that time.

459
0:47:48,000000 --> 0:47:48,990000
And not by chance, the rating of our committee,

460
0:47:52,000000 --> 0:47:52,990000
the first rating of party and personality was made in January,

461
0:47:57,000000 --> 0:47:57,990000
we were in second place after Eko-Glasnost.

462
0:48:00,000000 --> 0:48:00,990000
And unfortunately, from then on, if we have to see has happened in the last 26 years, we cannot ignore the fact that people have become very disillusioned,

463
0:48:10,000000 --> 0:48:10,990000
that communities have become disillusioned in our country, we have divided ourselves. Instead of unity, we have divided ourselves. We saw Ivan Angelov and Konstantin Trenchev, how they announced, but this was not the announcement itself.

464
0:48:30,000000 --> 0:48:30,990000
The announcement itself was at the back entrance of the Parliament by Alexander Lilov.

465
0:48:34,000000 --> 0:48:34,990000
Alexander Lilov with a megaphone, they are still the news, that the Central Committee, then the State Council,

466
0:48:40,000000 --> 0:48:40,990000
have made a decision, in principle, here the duty of the Communist Party must be given to it,

467
0:48:46,000000 --> 0:48:46,990000
to restore the right to free choice.

468
0:48:48,000000 --> 0:48:48,990000
Or to take part in it.

469
0:48:50,000000 --> 0:48:50,990000
That's why I want to speak on purpose, if I may.

470
0:48:52,000000 --> 0:48:52,990000
Yes, that's right. To take part in it.

471
0:48:54,000000 --> 0:48:54,990000
To take a decision to restore the right to free choice.

472
0:49:00,000000 --> 0:49:00,990000
After that, people...

473
0:49:04,000000 --> 0:49:04,990000
This same Hasyan Balko, threw themselves to welcome me.

474
0:49:07,000000 --> 0:49:07,990000
They literally went crazy with joy.

475
0:49:13,000000 --> 0:49:13,990000
And so, very happy, happy, they went out in front of the Parliament.

476
0:49:20,000000 --> 0:49:20,990000
And then they showed the scenes, and all the televisions showed, there were not many telev back then, but on TV they showed Konstantin Trenchev and Ivan Angelov.

477
0:49:29,000000 --> 0:49:29,990000
These two were ordered as culprits throughout Bulgaria, that they actually destroy national unity,

478
0:49:36,000000 --> 0:49:36,990000
because this is the path on which the idea of the Bulgarian nation as a monolithic socialist nation,

479
0:49:43,000000 --> 0:49:43,990000
in which there are no Turks, there and no Bulgarians, was broken.

480
0:49:46,000000 --> 0:49:46,990000
These were the main culprits.

481
0:49:48,000000 --> 0:49:48,990000
But there is something else.

482
0:49:50,000000 --> 0:49:50,990000
At this moment, they are still not sure who exactly returned the names.

483
0:49:56,000000 --> 0:49:56,990000
Was it thanks to the informal movement of the Democratic Forces?

484
0:50:00,000000 --> 0:50:00,990000
Or was it the Bulgarian Communist Party?

485
0:50:04,000000 --> 0:50:04,990000
A few years later, the protests of the nationalists organized by the same party began.

486
0:50:08,000000 --> 0:50:08,990000
But let's see exactly this over-exaggeration

487
0:50:12,000000 --> 0:50:12,990000
about who has the merit of returning the names.

488
0:50:22,000000 --> 0:50:22,990000
I'm healthy. I've been sleeping for three days already.

489
0:50:24,000000 --> 0:50:24,990000
I'm healthy.

490
0:50:26,000000 --> 0:50:26,990000
You'll see a man who for the first time

491
0:50:30,000000 --> 0:50:30,990000
asks me what I'm doing there and why I'm filming.

492
0:50:33,000000 --> 0:50:33,990000
Increase the volume.

493
0:50:35,000000 --> 0:50:35,990000
I'm healthy.

494
0:50:37,000000 --> 0:50:37,990000
But my wish is...

495
0:50:39,000000 --> 0:50:39,990000
You're healthy.

496
0:50:41,000000 --> 0:50:41,990000
Come on.

497
0:50:43,000000 --> 0:50:43,990000
You're healthy. You are the most heroic of all.

498
0:50:49,000000 --> 0:50:49,990000
You are the most heroic of all.

499
0:50:52,000000 --> 0:50:52,990000
You are the most heroic of all.

500
0:50:56,000000 --> 0:50:56,990000
You are the most heroic of all.

501
0:51:00,000000 --> 0:51:00,990000
You are the most heroic of all.

502
0:51:04,000000 --> 0:51:04,990000
You are the most name of the tombstone is written.

503
0:51:09,000000 --> 0:51:09,990000
But not as it was, the names of the people who fought against the truth were thrown out of the monuments.

504
0:51:16,000000 --> 0:51:16,990000
In the name of the United Democratic Forces,

505
0:51:19,000000 --> 0:51:19,990000
I wish you all the best in the new year.

506
0:51:24,000000 --> 0:51:24,990000
And know that this is just the beginning for many things we have to fight for.

507
0:51:29,000000 --> 0:51:29,990000
We all have to be together and always support each other.

508
0:51:34,000000 --> 0:51:34,990000
Thank you for being here, thank you for being here, thank you for being so happy on this day.

509
0:51:43,000000 --> 0:51:43,990000
The Roma youth in the 5th baron we see, actually turned out to be demagogues The on the party's leadership! This is not a protest against the opposition!

510
0:52:09,000000 --> 0:52:09,990000
This is a protest against the election!

511
0:52:12,000000 --> 0:52:12,990000
Democracy!

512
0:52:25,000000 --> 0:52:25,990000
Democracy! Democracy!

513
0:52:32,000000 --> 0:52:32,990000
Rume Vodinicharov and Peter Beron changed their positions over the years.

514
0:52:42,000000 --> 0:52:42,990000
The next year, the one who became a member of the BBSP coalition and the nationalist, I'm talking about Rume Vodinicharov.

515
0:52:45,000000 --> 0:52:45,990000
The other one, Peter Beron, entered the parliamentary group

516
0:52:50,000000 --> 0:52:50,990000
together with the attack and protection a few years ago.

517
0:52:54,000000 --> 0:52:54,990000
And I don't want them to remember then, but I don't know if they were honest then

518
0:53:00,000000 --> 0:53:00,990000
or if a big game was played,, we will talk about them first.

519
0:53:05,000000 --> 0:53:05,990000
And please, regardless of the fact that we may be one minute late,

520
0:53:11,000000 --> 0:53:11,990000
let's play a video.

521
0:53:24,000000 --> 0:53:24,990000
We need it! We need it! These people speak more than against hatred, more than any words.

522
0:53:31,000000 --> 0:53:31,990000
We need it! We need it! Freedom! Freedom!

523
0:53:55,000000 --> 0:53:55,990000
This was Eliko Varcheva, a correspondent for Freedom of Europe.

524
0:53:59,000000 --> 0:53:59,990000
He is from DOS again.

525
0:54:03,000000 --> 0:54:03,990000
And here something were drinking something.

526
0:54:30,000000 --> 0:54:30,990000
I asked a Turkish man who was standing next to me and crying, what they were singing. He answered me that they were singing hymns in praise of Allah and the government.

527
0:54:37,000000 --> 0:54:37,990000
They were not interested in what the government was, but they were grateful to the government that they would get their names back.

528
0:54:49,000000 --> 0:54:49,990000
I also asked and they told me that this is a prayer for gratitude.

529
0:54:54,000000 --> 0:54:54,990000
Yes, yes.

530
0:54:55,000000 --> 0:54:55,990000
And they repeat the same thing.

531
0:54:57,000000 --> 0:54:57,990000
Thank you, Lord.

532
0:54:59,000000 --> 0:54:59,990000
Or thank Allah.

533
0:55:01,000000 --> 0:55:01,990000
Yes. I am very scared that at the moment when all these current events are going on, the whole hybrid war that is being waged, They have a very big patriotic attitude. They are again attacking us against others.

534
0:55:46,000000 --> 0:55:46,990000
They are attacking us against our neighbors.

535
0:55:49,000000 --> 0:55:49,990000
They are making us to choose.

536
0:55:52,000000 --> 0:55:52,990000
And we have made our choice years ago.

537
0:55:57,000000 --> 0:55:57,990000
We have made our choice and the majority of Bulgarians and this election is democracy, freedom, Europe and ordinary human feelings

538
0:56:11,500000 --> 0:56:17
such as solidarity, cohesion, respect.

539
0:56:20,000000 --> 0:56:20,990000
And the conversation will probably continue, Misho, but a little further, because in the next show,

540
0:56:31,000000 --> 0:56:31,990000
especially, there will be said and heard things that are personally surprising to me.

541
0:57:06,000000 --> 0:57:06,990000
The next lecture was about a little boy, a boy of 9 years, 10 years, who was waiting for his father in Istanbul. He was 4 years and 6 months old.

542
0:57:11,000000 --> 0:57:11,990000
He was released after 6 months, when Ahmed Dogan and the others around him were already free.

543
0:57:20,000000 --> 0:57:20,990000
After the first movement was organized, it was first liberated. And Mehmed, together with many others who were really against the communist regime,

544
0:57:35,000000 --> 0:57:35,990000
were first released from prison, and then forced to leave Bulgaria. Misho, you know a lot about this, don't you?

545
0:57:47,000000 --> 0:57:47,990000
I know, I know. It's difficult because in this format of this show, the image is, first of all, extremely exciting,

546
0:58:00,000000 --> 0:58:00,990000
but I try to write some things and then the whole story is told as it was.

547
0:58:07,000000 --> 0:58:07,990000
If you write something, I will add the footage.

548
0:58:13,000000 --> 0:58:13,990000
There are some things in the book that were published.

549
0:58:15,000000 --> 0:58:15,990000
I think it will be useful for young people.

550
0:58:17,000000 --> 0:58:17,990000
Yes, of course.

551
0:58:18,000000 --> 0:58:18,990000
For historical memory and so that we do not repeat our mistakes all the time, so that we don't live in the past unfinished.

552
0:58:29,000000 --> 0:58:29,990000
This is the picture with the grown-up Rossen, with his real name Reza and his father,

553
0:58:39,000000 --> 0:58:39,990000
who had an extremely difficult fate in the Bulgarian prison before the 10th of November.

554
0:58:51,000000 --> 0:58:51,990000
Goodbye for the delay, goodbye for the emotions, goodbye Misho, that we can't finish the conversation, but I'm glad we can continue it.

555
0:59:04,000000 --> 0:59:04,990000
The material is very exciting.

556
0:59:06,000000 --> 0:59:06,990000
Thank you.
