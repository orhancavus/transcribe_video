1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
Hello! You are watching the Big Question. I am Ivan Bedrov.

2
0:00:05,000000 --> 0:00:05,990000
We have headed today's episode â€“ 3 apartments, 2 shacks and 1 hotel.

3
0:00:10,000000 --> 0:00:10,990000
Where do Peevski and Dugan live?

4
0:00:13,000000 --> 0:00:13,990000
Probably, the question is about other numbers and bigger ones.

5
0:00:17,000000 --> 0:00:17,990000
Not only about 3 apartments, 2 shacks and 1 hotel, but also about the question question of where Dogan and Peevski live.

6
0:00:26,000000 --> 0:00:26,990000
Actually, there were not so many questions about Dogan and about Peevski, there were more unknown questions.

7
0:00:34,000000 --> 0:00:34,990000
Last month, we, the journalists YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook

8
0:00:51,400000 --> 0:00:56,200000
they have almost 900 thousand views in just two weeks and a half.

9
0:00:56,200000 --> 0:01:04,400000
Just to remind you that in the last parliamentary elections the first two political forces, the first two in general, had so many votes.

10
0:01:04,400000 --> 0:01:08,500000
That is, we are really talking is a big interest for this topic.

11
0:01:08,500000 --> 0:01:13,500000
Today we are together with the journalist Genka Shikerova.

12
0:01:13,500000 --> 0:01:14,500000
Hello, Genka!

13
0:01:14,500000 --> 0:01:15,500000
Hello!

14
0:01:15,500000 --> 0:01:20,500000
How are you and your friend and your property register today?

15
0:01:20,500000 --> 0:01:25,500000
We did not communicate today because we did't have the opportunity to do so.

16
0:01:25,500000 --> 0:01:28,500000
This is a big exception.

17
0:01:28,500000 --> 0:01:40,500000
Genka was the journalist who did the main part of the story we published and the investigation of where Delian Peevski lives.

18
0:01:40,500000 --> 0:01:47
It's not just about curiosity, it's not only about the food or the food where someone lives.

19
0:01:47,000000 --> 0:01:47,990000
Today we will talk about the specific properties and why this issue is important.

20
0:01:52,000000 --> 0:01:52,990000
Why two leading politicians who will now, after a few weeks, stop again to seek the trust of their voters,

21
0:02:00,000000 --> 0:02:00,990000
and then one or two, it depends on the configuration, will want to rule again.

22
0:02:05,300000 --> 0:02:10
It is good to know where these two live.

23
0:02:10,000000 --> 0:02:10,990000
And not only that. It is good when they speak, they present some positions.

24
0:02:14,000000 --> 0:02:14,990000
We should know something more about them.

25
0:02:16,000000 --> 0:02:16,990000
This is how it is in normal democracies.

26
0:02:19,000000 --> 0:02:19,990000
So today we will talk not only about specific assets, and quadrature, and rent prices, but also about why this is important in our profession and how exactly we got to the information we present to you.

27
0:02:32,400000 --> 0:02:42
And so, I already told you, together with Genka Shikerova, short answer, do you have where Ahmet Dogan and Dalyan Peevski live today?

28
0:02:42,000000 --> 0:02:42,990000
I don't know about either of them.

29
0:02:45,000000 --> 0:02:45,990000
And here, our viewers, probably, now be careful not to laugh, because our viewers would probably say,

30
0:02:53,000000 --> 0:02:53,990000
why do you ask them so much? What do they answer?

31
0:02:57,000000 --> 0:02:57,990000
Nothing.

32
0:02:59,000000 --> 0:02:59,990000
This is a short answer. It is not a natural communication. I have a connection with you, with the people from the editorial office,

33
0:03:11,760000 --> 0:03:14,240000
not with you in the official form.

34
0:03:14,240000 --> 0:03:23,840000
We have talked about the fact that we have been looking for answers to the question

35
0:03:23,840000 --> 0:03:25,240000
where and how they live.

36
0:03:25,240000 --> 0:03:27,640000
I was a bit distracted because I was calling on the phone.

37
0:03:27,640000 --> 0:03:29,640000
But so far we have not found any.

38
0:03:29,640000 --> 0:03:35,440000
This is also something that most of our viewers probably do not know.

39
0:03:35,440000 --> 0:03:42,840000
The way we try to communicate, but in fact we do not communicate with most of the people who see the news.

40
0:03:42,840000 --> 0:03:49
Because the most normal thing is to ask someone, if not directly, but if there are bigger organizations for these people.

41
0:03:49,000000 --> 0:03:49,990000
There are people who do this work, whether they are press centers, media advisors.

42
0:03:54,000000 --> 0:03:54,990000
But especially with Mr. Peski, there is a wall there.

43
0:03:57,000000 --> 0:03:57,990000
We have a wall for many years and probably many colleagues journalists have tried to ask questions about what is not there and we never get an answer.

44
0:04:06,600000 --> 0:04:12,800000
We are so used to the fact that we forget to do what is our duty.

45
0:04:12,800000 --> 0:04:15,200000
We just keep asking.

46
0:04:15,200000 --> 0:04:18,400000
No one picks up the phone, no one returns an email afterwards.

47
0:04:18,400000 --> 0:04:28,560000
You, for example, often joke that you have a part in which you communicate with yourself. That was the joke I had a while ago, which I forgot to tell you.

48
0:04:28,560000 --> 0:04:36
I wrote to myself and I didn't wait for an answer, because everything is from one side of the chat.

49
0:04:38,000000 --> 0:04:38,990000
Okay. How did we decide to ask ourselves the question of where Delian Peevski lives.

50
0:04:47,000000 --> 0:04:47,990000
How did we get there?

51
0:04:49,000000 --> 0:04:49,990000
The story begins with the exhumation of Ahmed Dogan from the buildings he lived in.

52
0:04:58,000000 --> 0:04:58,990000
It is difficult for me to use the word residence, simply because I feel more at in the living room, because I miss the moment when I see the buildings in Boyana, the so-called sarays, and the sea to look for Ahmed Dogan, where he lived, where he is now.

53
0:05:32,000000 --> 0:05:32,990000
The topic of the DPR,

54
0:05:50,400000 --> 0:05:59,200000
while his supporters, party members, most likely live and use much more modest housing.

55
0:05:59,200000 --> 0:06:12,520000
In fact, until September 1, if I'm not mistaken, it was the day when national television reported that Ahmed Dogan had left the so-called Saray in Rosenec and we saw the first shots from the inside.

56
0:06:12,520000 --> 0:06:16,320000
Before that, we knew how these buildings looked from the outside.

57
0:06:16,320000 --> 0:06:20,400000
For example, I was walking along the old Belovodski path and I heard the bells.

58
0:06:20,400000 --> 0:06:46,300000
I don't know what to pronounce the sound of the The places that Ahmed Dogan lived in, which are not accessible to us.

59
0:06:46,300000 --> 0:06:55,500000
Interestingly, the building on Rosenec, I followed it from the moment when it was not connected to Ahmed Dogan.

60
0:06:55,500000 --> 0:07:05
It had started its construction and not allowed to go there.

61
0:07:05,000000 --> 0:07:05,990000
There was a barrier that was placed at the very beginning of the road,

62
0:07:11,000000 --> 0:07:11,990000
leading to the wider area where the beach was located.

63
0:07:17,000000 --> 0:07:17,990000
Let's imagine that.

64
0:07:19,000000 --> 0:07:19,990000
In the warm weather, you go to the beach with your children.

65
0:07:23,000000 --> 0:07:23,990000
Yes, that to the beach. Yes, that's true.

66
0:07:25,000000 --> 0:07:25,990000
And at the moment, this is the area where I had access to in practice.

67
0:07:31,000000 --> 0:07:31,990000
It was much wider, farther from the place we saw on the common plan

68
0:07:36,000000 --> 0:07:36,990000
above the building.

69
0:07:38,000000 --> 0:07:38,990000
And I really had absolutely no visibility of what was being built.

70
0:07:43,000000 --> 0:07:43,990000
There were no tables, because usually when there is construction,

71
0:07:47,760000 --> 0:07:53,440000
there are tables with the investor, the period in which the building should be built, what was being built.

72
0:07:53,440000 --> 0:07:56,640000
Do you remember which year you tried to go to the beach?

73
0:07:56,640000 --> 0:08:08
It was about 10 years ago when I tried to go to the beach, or something like that.

74
0:08:08,000000 --> 0:08:08,990000
Exactly. As far as I remember, in 2014, the first reports came that something was being built there.

75
0:08:14,000000 --> 0:08:14,990000
Yes, and it was very interesting for me, because they told me that they would not let me go there again,

76
0:08:20,000000 --> 0:08:20,990000
to see what was happening.

77
0:08:22,000000 --> 0:08:22,990000
And from then on, this building became interesting to me.

78
0:08:26,000000 --> 0:08:26,990000
The only way to see this building was to go to the sea,

79
0:08:32,000000 --> 0:08:32,990000
or to wait for satellite images to be published on Google,

80
0:08:39,000000 --> 0:08:39,990000
to see exactly what happened. The first ones who went to the water were from the website Bivou.

81
0:08:50,000000 --> 0:08:50,990000
They had not yet been divided with BERT.

82
0:08:53,000000 --> 0:08:53,990000
Then there was a lot of noise about the companies, what exactly is going on, what kind of construction is going on.

83
0:09:01,000000 --> 0:09:01,990000
But Dogan was not yet present as a name and as a future inhabitant of these buildings.

84
0:09:08,200000 --> 0:09:20
We started this topic, which is very interesting, but we will return to it a little later and now we will jump over this topic quickly.

85
0:09:20,000000 --> 0:09:20,990000
We saw at one point what these buildings look like from the were like and Ahmed Dogan was kicked out.

86
0:09:26,000000 --> 0:09:26,990000
Why? If you are interested, you will find out in a bit.

87
0:09:30,000000 --> 0:09:30,990000
But this is the moment when we talked in the editorial office every morning, as we meet.

88
0:09:37,000000 --> 0:09:37,990000
And we expected that in the next few days, after the big national TV stations showed the Saray TV and the topic was being talked about,

89
0:09:45,000000 --> 0:09:45,990000
they will show us where Dalian Peevski lives.

90
0:09:48,000000 --> 0:09:48,990000
We are a small editorial office, we do what we can, we choose.

91
0:09:52,000000 --> 0:09:52,990000
We often have to choose which 9 topics to discuss, which 10 topics to cover,

92
0:09:57,000000 --> 0:09:57,990000
because we are small people and we have little resources.

93
0:10:00,000000 --> 0:10:00,990000
And even if we cover something, we will do it than the big media with tens, maybe hundreds of journalists.

94
0:10:06,000000 --> 0:10:06,990000
We expected to see in the next day, the next week, to see some kind of report where Delian Peski lives.

95
0:10:12,000000 --> 0:10:12,990000
But I did not see. I do not know, maybe I did not watch regularly. I do not know if you saw.

96
0:10:17,000000 --> 0:10:17,990000
I watched regularly, but I did not see. There was not even such a question.

97
0:10:20,000000 --> 0:10:20,990000
And all this happens against the context of the declarations that are being issued to the Anti-Corruption Commission,

98
0:10:32,000000 --> 0:10:32,990000
where the property, income and so on are described.

99
0:10:35,000000 --> 0:10:35,990000
Who and what does he have, he declares every year.

100
0:10:37,000000 --> 0:10:37,990000
Yes, he declares what he has and it was already clear what Peevski has, what he has declared. He was very interested in journalism.

101
0:10:48,000000 --> 0:10:48,990000
We are talking about a simple reporter's reflex, not something very difficult to achieve as an idea.

102
0:10:56,000000 --> 0:10:56,990000
And now I will reveal something from their family, and after they do it, I have to do it.

103
0:11:09,600000 --> 0:11:29
And how did we get to these properties, which we will show you in a moment, where Dalian Peevski lives, or we assume that he uses it as a house. If I may use the word here in very Bacallian terms, simply because we do not have access to some incredible databases,

104
0:11:29,000000 --> 0:11:29,990000
we use public information,

105
0:11:31,000000 --> 0:11:31,990000
what a regular journalist uses is not to throw us folders, ideas and all that material,

106
0:11:37,000000 --> 0:11:37,990000
not to open the doors of the residences to which we have access,

107
0:11:40,000000 --> 0:11:40,990000
not to invite us. We have access to the You wanted to make it more detailed, to make it all simple, to make them respond.

108
0:12:05,280000 --> 0:12:07,640000
But it was done in the Bakal method.

109
0:12:07,640000 --> 0:12:09,640000
That's the way it is.

110
0:12:09,640000 --> 0:12:16,160000
I was afraid at some point of the course, but it was possible.

111
0:12:16,160000 --> 0:12:24,520000
Because of this reason, remembering what is written in the years,

112
0:12:24,520000 --> 0:12:27
those who have been involved was written in the years, those who were involved in this most,

113
0:12:27,000000 --> 0:12:27,990000
a non-governmental organization that existed around 2013, called the protest network,

114
0:12:33,000000 --> 0:12:33,990000
they had and supported a site called No Resharski and were investigating the property of the Delian Peevski. What they described was a network of properties,

115
0:12:48,000000 --> 0:12:48,990000
a network of companies that belonged to Delian Peevski and his mother.

116
0:12:53,000000 --> 0:12:53,990000
Delian Peevski, who, just to remind you,

117
0:12:56,000000 --> 0:12:56,990000
was for the most part, with one exception,

118
0:13:02,000000 --> 0:13:02,990000
let's say for several months, when he was a lawyer, he was on a state budget.

119
0:13:14,000000 --> 0:13:14,990000
His mother was...

120
0:13:16,000000 --> 0:13:16,990000
I just wanted to remind you. She was a investigator, a deputy, a deputy minister.

121
0:13:22,000000 --> 0:13:22,990000
And the three of them in the state service.

122
0:13:25,000000 --> 0:13:25,990000
Yes, and one day he was the director of DANS.

123
0:13:28,000000 --> 0:13:28,990000
Yes, he was.

124
0:13:30,000000 --> 0:13:30,990000
His mother was the director of TOTO.

125
0:13:33,000000 --> 0:13:33,990000
Before that, we don't know what she was doing.

126
0:13:37,000000 --> 0:13:37,990000
I checked her in the registries and there is really no information to lead you to think that the family has a lot of serious capital to buy real estate.

127
0:13:54,000000 --> 0:13:54,990000
As the director of TOTO, I don't know what the salary is, associations take more than they take, let's say,

128
0:14:05,880000 --> 0:14:10,440000
if you are directly to the Ministry of Sports.

129
0:14:10,440000 --> 0:14:19,200000
What they discover on the protest network is that there is a question of the cost of the very luxurious things

130
0:14:19,200000 --> 0:14:21,200000
that they use in different companies.

131
0:14:21,200000 --> 0:14:30
They describe them, they take pictures of them, they go there, they research photos, public information, offshore companies.

132
0:14:30,000000 --> 0:14:30,990000
And what I decided to do, because the public has also known

133
0:14:38,000000 --> 0:14:38,990000
that Peevski, one of his sanctioned companies, Interest, which is his company.

134
0:14:47,600000 --> 0:14:56,240000
He had a lot of property, which at one point was sold.

135
0:14:56,240000 --> 0:15:08
I decided to see if it is not a question of the same property. The only thing...

136
0:15:08,000000 --> 0:15:08,990000
Just to add a little to this story.

137
0:15:11,000000 --> 0:15:11,990000
In 2021, Dalyan Paevski was sanctioned for corruption by the USA,

138
0:15:17,000000 --> 0:15:17,990000
a year later by the UK, which in practice means that he has no right not have a bank card, bank account or to operate with them.

139
0:15:28,000000 --> 0:15:28,990000
Because every institution that works with a sanctioned person, risks losing the right to work with the US dollar.

140
0:15:36,000000 --> 0:15:36,990000
Since the sanctions are imposed by the company sold its assets. We can assume that this was to facilitate Mr. Pevski's operations.

141
0:15:54,300000 --> 0:15:58,600000
And you decided to check whether he was living under rent with his own assets.

142
0:15:58,600000 --> 0:16:02,600000
Yes, but we are thinking about the bank card only.

143
0:16:02,600000 --> 0:16:07
It should be like that. It is a bit wishful thinking.

144
0:16:07,000000 --> 0:16:07,990000
Yes, because this is a topic that we have started to check.

145
0:16:11,000000 --> 0:16:11,990000
We have sent various inquiries to the institutions.

146
0:16:14,000000 --> 0:16:14,990000
Is he entitled to do so?

147
0:16:17,000000 --> 0:16:17,990000
Because from his declaration it is clear that he has debts in the left and in the euro.

148
0:16:23,000000 --> 0:16:23,990000
One dollar has disappeared after the sanctions.

149
0:16:26,000000 --> 0:16:26,990000
There are properties for which he pays a lot of rents.

150
0:16:29,000000 --> 0:16:29,990000
In general, he is living his life in a normal way, at least that's what it looks like on documents.

151
0:16:35,000000 --> 0:16:35,990000
At the same time, from the meeting, including the Magnitsky Commission,

152
0:16:39,000000 --> 0:16:39,990000
which was to one of the previous National Assembly, of which I no longer remember the numbers,

153
0:16:43,000000 --> 0:16:43,990000
then some very scary things were being said things being said about the country's financial system

154
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
if any bank would pay to Peevski.

155
0:16:54,000000 --> 0:16:54,990000
It turned out that this is not the case.

156
0:16:58,000000 --> 0:16:58,990000
But this is another topic. You printed the P.Evski's property declaration,

157
0:17:07,000000 --> 0:17:07,990000
you looked at the properties that belonged to his company, Interest,

158
0:17:12,000000 --> 0:17:12,990000
and what did you start to put information on top of each other?

159
0:17:16,000000 --> 0:17:16,990000
Yes, to see where the cross-check came from.

160
0:17:18,000000 --> 0:17:18,990000
Actually, for four properties, the cross-check came of the square is measured. I assume that the next step is to remove the column with the square from the next decorations,

161
0:17:30,000000 --> 0:17:30,990000
so that there is more of the square.

162
0:17:32,000000 --> 0:17:32,990000
Yes, it is better to write that there is an amount, there is a car, or there is no amount, there is no car, period.

163
0:17:37,000000 --> 0:17:37,990000
Probably, so that no one can do such things.

164
0:17:40,000000 --> 0:17:40,990000
Okay, we will look at them one by one, these matching amounts, but we will start with the biggest thing, the most popular.

165
0:17:49,600000 --> 0:17:54
Mr. Dele Ampeevski was in contact with the Hotel Berlin for many years.

166
0:17:54,000000 --> 0:17:54,990000
Most of our viewers have not visited the Hotel Berlin, they have not passed by it, because it is not in such a prominent position. Maybe they don't know him at all. But back in 2013, when Deleon Peevski was elected, even just for a day,

167
0:18:09,000000 --> 0:18:09,990000
as the chairman of the National Security Agency,

168
0:18:12,000000 --> 0:18:12,990000
and this caused 400 days of protests, after the government's request for a leave,

169
0:18:18,000000 --> 0:18:18,990000
back then there were such small protests, like the flash mob, in front of this hotel in Berlin, because it was said that Dalyan Peevski lives there.

170
0:18:28,800000 --> 0:18:47,680000
I even remember that one of the representatives of the protest network mentioned that this is a group of people who to swim in the pool of the Hotel Berlin.

171
0:18:47,680000 --> 0:18:52,480000
At that time, the access was only to the pool.

172
0:18:52,480000 --> 0:18:56,800000
You couldn't stay in the hotel, but you could go to swim.

173
0:18:56,800000 --> 0:19:10
Later, the pool was closed, and if you look at the Google Maps, this building is still designated as a hotel, but it says Permanently closed.

174
0:19:10,000000 --> 0:19:10,990000
It was there recently. What is there?

175
0:19:15,000000 --> 0:19:15,990000
A lady even filmed me.

176
0:19:17,000000 --> 0:19:17,990000
Because we are filming.

177
0:19:20,000000 --> 0:19:20,990000
She is not a receptionist.

178
0:19:22,000000 --> 0:19:22,990000
She is not a receptionist. She went out, she took the camera, the receptionist. The woman is in the room, the operator is in the room,

179
0:19:26,000000 --> 0:19:26,990000
Miroslav Mikhailov is in the room,

180
0:19:28,000000 --> 0:19:28,990000
and he continues his journey.

181
0:19:30,000000 --> 0:19:30,990000
But this is not a hotel anymore.

182
0:19:32,000000 --> 0:19:32,990000
This is a closed complex,

183
0:19:34,000000 --> 0:19:34,990000
which is sold as an apartment.

184
0:19:36,000000 --> 0:19:36,990000
There is an ad,

185
0:19:38,000000 --> 0:19:38,990000
which you can see in the footage

186
0:19:40,000000 --> 0:19:40,990000
we have published.

187
0:19:42,000000 --> 0:19:42,990000
There are ads for the sale of apartments.

188
0:19:44,000000 --> 0:19:44,990000
There are ads for the sale of apartments.

189
0:19:45,200000 --> 0:19:47,200000
When you go to the website...

190
0:19:47,200000 --> 0:19:49,200000
It's not a small thing, it's not a family hotel.

191
0:19:49,200000 --> 0:19:51,200000
We are talking about a big hotel.

192
0:19:51,200000 --> 0:19:53,200000
Yes, it's big as a complex.

193
0:19:53,200000 --> 0:19:57,200000
It is advertised with serious security measures.

194
0:19:57,200000 --> 0:19:59,200000
Silence, tranquility.

195
0:19:59,200000 --> 0:20:08
What is on the website as information is that 2,000 euros per square meter is the price of the housing post is 2000 euros per square meter.

196
0:20:08,000000 --> 0:20:08,990000
There are also taxis for subsidies, which are paid in such closed housing. from the protest network, they had also filmed

197
0:20:26,000000 --> 0:20:26,990000
that according to them

198
0:20:29,000000 --> 0:20:29,990000
the house that Peevski lived in

199
0:20:32,000000 --> 0:20:32,990000
was on the last floor of the hotel

200
0:20:35,000000 --> 0:20:35,990000
and in order to have no visibility

201
0:20:38,000000 --> 0:20:38,990000
of the house, a live fence

202
0:20:41,000000 --> 0:20:41,990000
was made of plants

203
0:20:44,000000 --> 0:20:44,990000
that are high up, so that they can hide the sight of the person who is moving, what he is doing and so on.

204
0:20:50,000000 --> 0:20:50,990000
What I managed to understand is that until recently, Peevskiy had made his meetings in the Hotel Berlin.

205
0:20:59,000000 --> 0:20:59,990000
Vizhdi Rashidov, by the way.

206
0:21:02,000000 --> 0:21:02,990000
I heard it on TV. V they saw each other drinking coffee.

207
0:21:07,000000 --> 0:21:07,990000
Yes, I think that Cvetan Cvetanov was the first former Minister of the Interior, the second man in the coat of arms,

208
0:21:13,000000 --> 0:21:13,990000
who publicly said that he had seen the two-thousand-ir Tzatzarov and Borislav Tzarafov.

209
0:21:33,000000 --> 0:21:33,990000
Sotir Tzatzarov is the former chief prosecutor, at the moment he is the chief prosecutor.

210
0:21:38,000000 --> 0:21:38,990000
Borislav Tzarafov is the current chief prosecutor or the one who performs the functions.

211
0:21:42,000000 --> 0:21:42,990000
I am just adding to the list for the people who are not so attentive.

212
0:21:46,000000 --> 0:21:46,990000
But, let's go back to the main question.

213
0:21:50,000000 --> 0:21:50,990000
Why do we do this? Why do we tell people all this?

214
0:21:53,000000 --> 0:21:53,990000
Why is it important for a politician to know where and under what conditions he lives?

215
0:21:59,000000 --> 0:21:59,990000
I remember that years ago, maybe more than 10 years ago,

216
0:22:03,000000 --> 0:22:03,990000
I was in Berlin and there, near the river, in front of the museums, there was an old yellow building.

217
0:22:09,000000 --> 0:22:09,990000
In front of it, as we say, there was a small police booth and a police car.

218
0:22:14,000000 --> 0:22:14,990000
And then my relatives told me that Angela Merkel was living there.

219
0:22:18,000000 --> 0:22:18,990000
At that time Angela Merkel was the Chancellor of Germany, a very strong figure, and it can be said that he was the head of Europe at that time.

220
0:22:27,000000 --> 0:22:27,990000
Everyone knows where he lived, even the neighbours know what time and day he would leave the block and go to the supermarket.

221
0:22:36,000000 --> 0:22:36,990000
In Bulgaria, we are no exception. The long-time prime minister Boiko Boris with a desire, showed his house in the bank where he lived.

222
0:22:47,000000 --> 0:22:47,990000
Even politicians go there for official meetings. This is not a secret.

223
0:22:52,000000 --> 0:22:52,990000
A previous prime minister, Ivan Kostov, did not show his house in Dragalevci, but he has spoken many times, and everyone can go and see and know where he lives. A former prime minister, Kiril Petkov, also showed and filmed outside and inside.

224
0:23:11,140000 --> 0:23:15,340000
He is in the center of Sofia, on Tsar Ivan Shishman street, his apartment.

225
0:23:15,340000 --> 0:23:19,340000
All this is known. Not only in the world, but also in Bulgaria.

226
0:23:19,340000 --> 0:23:23,140000
The only one who is not known is Mr. Dalian Peeski.

227
0:23:23,140000 --> 0:23:28
This still surprises me. I don't know if you are used to this thought.

228
0:23:28,000000 --> 0:23:28,990000
There is no way to get used to this thought.

229
0:23:32,000000 --> 0:23:32,990000
From time to time you come to me, ask me a question and you don't get an answer.

230
0:23:37,000000 --> 0:23:37,990000
This is the cycle that is repeated at least until now. I know that we have already talked about you in the last episodes, but now I would like you to tell our viewers the places you visited.

231
0:23:52,640000 --> 0:24:01,520000
When you put this square on the apartments that Delian Peevski uses for rent, with those that have been his property until recently,

232
0:24:01,520000 --> 0:24:04,720000
he identifies three places in Sofia.

233
0:24:04,720000 --> 0:24:06
Four. You said that there are four properties, but two of the map until very soon. She identifies three places in Sofia. Four.

234
0:24:06,000000 --> 0:24:06,990000
She says that there are four properties, but two of them are one to another.

235
0:24:09,000000 --> 0:24:09,990000
Yes, if you have a pre-existing property, yes.

236
0:24:11,000000 --> 0:24:11,990000
Yes, that's how it comes out.

237
0:24:13,000000 --> 0:24:13,990000
Let's start with the first one.

238
0:24:15,000000 --> 0:24:15,990000
Actually, three of these four are in the Simionov district.

239
0:24:17,000000 --> 0:24:17,990000
But the first thing that she identifies is on Zlatan Vek Street in the Simionov district.

240
0:24:23,000000 --> 0:24:23,990000
What did she see on Zlatan Vek Street in the Simionov district?

241
0:24:34,600000 --> 0:24:40,400000
Zlatan Vek Street was actually marked as the second source of information. It was quite a coincidence that I happened to be at a protest in February

242
0:24:40,400000 --> 0:24:50
by a former dancer from Dans, who was protesting in front of the house of Delian Peevski in Simeonovo.

243
0:24:50,000000 --> 0:24:50,990000
In front of this building.

244
0:24:52,000000 --> 0:24:52,990000
So, from two places, in some way, specifically for this...

245
0:24:56,000000 --> 0:24:56,990000
So, one person was protesting in front of...

246
0:24:58,000000 --> 0:24:58,990000
Well, he was organizing a protest.

247
0:25:00,000000 --> 0:25:00,990000
And there were him and two or three other women.

248
0:25:02,000000 --> 0:25:02,990000
At least, this is seen in the video.

249
0:25:04,000000 --> 0:25:04,990000
They were protesting there.

250
0:25:06,000000 --> 0:25:06,990000
For what reason did they go there?

251
0:25:09,000000 --> 0:25:09,990000
This protest was not reflected in the video.

252
0:25:12,000000 --> 0:25:12,990000
There is a video on YouTube, if you want to watch it and understand more.

253
0:25:16,000000 --> 0:25:16,990000
The building itself is very big.

254
0:25:21,000000 --> 0:25:21,990000
I am really curious. These people go there to protest because the security guards block the streets, because they are blocked by the police.

255
0:25:32,000000 --> 0:25:32,990000
They protested against PS.

256
0:25:34,000000 --> 0:25:34,990000
And his role probably in the whole state.

257
0:25:36,000000 --> 0:25:36,990000
Yes.

258
0:25:38,000000 --> 0:25:38,990000
The city of Motse is located on a very narrow street, where you can pass with one car. Two cars can't pass.

259
0:25:46,520000 --> 0:25:55,320000
What he said in the video during the protest is that there were cars,

260
0:25:55,320000 --> 0:25:59,320000
which are called Rosen Milenov, I just remembered,

261
0:25:59,320000 --> 0:26:03,320000
that there are cars of the police in one and the other end of the street.

262
0:26:03,320000 --> 0:26:05
We have never seen anything like this on the streets.

263
0:26:05,000000 --> 0:26:05,990000
The property is being preserved.

264
0:26:09,000000 --> 0:26:09,990000
You can see the green fence that is being built.

265
0:26:13,000000 --> 0:26:13,990000
It is impossible to see what is happening inside.

266
0:26:17,000000 --> 0:26:17,990000
At the moment, this property belongs to the company Strojko 2011.

267
0:26:22,000000 --> 0:26:22,990000
Who owns this company? The company was founded in 2011. The owner of the company is a member of the company

268
0:26:26,000000 --> 0:26:26,990000
which, by the way,

269
0:26:29,000000 --> 0:26:29,990000
the company Interest, according to the capital survey,

270
0:26:32,000000 --> 0:26:32,990000
sells most of its assets.

271
0:26:35,000000 --> 0:26:35,990000
This is an MMA fighter.

272
0:26:38,000000 --> 0:26:38,990000
It is not very clear

273
0:26:41,000000 --> 0:26:41,990000
where he got so much money from,

274
0:26:44,000000 --> 0:26:44,990000
but anyway, he is the person who becomes the owner of the company.

275
0:26:48,000000 --> 0:26:48,990000
The property belongs to the company Interest.

276
0:26:52,000000 --> 0:26:52,990000
The property looked empty, there was no movement inside.

277
0:26:58,000000 --> 0:26:58,990000
The only visibility that this property has is from above.

278
0:27:06,640000 --> 0:27:10,640000
Why is it important whether there is or not security?

279
0:27:10,640000 --> 0:27:17,680000
Because Delian Peevski has always been well protected for at least 10 years.

280
0:27:17,680000 --> 0:27:28,300000
You can't meet him on the street, but when he comes to the National Assembly, he comes with at least two cars, which, whether they are armored or not, look like this from the outside.

281
0:27:28,300000 --> 0:27:32,300000
I didn't open the door to see them, especially on some of the cars.

282
0:27:32,300000 --> 0:27:34,300000
With a lot of security.

283
0:27:34,300000 --> 0:27:43,500000
Several times during these years, the National Security Service, which provides guards for senior politicians, for the prime minister, for the president, etc.,

284
0:27:43,500000 --> 0:27:46,400000
has confirmed that he is guarding Delian Peevski,

285
0:27:46,400000 --> 0:27:48,800000
because there is always some kind of fear for him.

286
0:27:48,800000 --> 0:27:53
They never tell us, because that is the procedure, but they protect him.

287
0:27:53,000000 --> 0:27:53,990000
And that is why, when we see that there is a booth somewhere, a barrier,

288
0:27:56,800000 --> 0:28:01,400000
a car that has parked and is not buzzing with the clock or with any other place,

289
0:28:01,400000 --> 0:28:03,800000
that is a sign that there may be such a person there.

290
0:28:03,800000 --> 0:28:07,300000
And now, when he left two weeks ago, you didn't see these signs before two weeks.

291
0:28:07,300000 --> 0:28:09,300000
No, there wasn't.

292
0:28:09,300000 --> 0:28:28
Maybe to be more precise, the rent for this assumed square and the property we identified is 219 000 levs. I guess it is a matter of annual rent, not monthly.

293
0:28:28,000000 --> 0:28:28,990000
But the column in the declaration is not specified.

294
0:28:31,000000 --> 0:28:31,990000
Yes, it is more logical to say so, but we do not know.

295
0:28:35,000000 --> 0:28:35,990000
It is not actually declared for months or years.

296
0:28:38,000000 --> 0:28:38,990000
And how, actually?

297
0:28:39,000000 --> 0:28:39,990000
That is, where from a deputy payment?

298
0:28:41,000000 --> 0:28:41,990000
How can a person have so much money for so many rents?

299
0:28:44,000000 --> 0:28:44,990000
And how, after there is a limit on payment in the amount, you don't have to have bank accounts and cards to pay them?

300
0:28:49,200000 --> 0:28:51,200000
These are other topics.

301
0:28:51,200000 --> 0:28:53,200000
This is the property on Zlatanveg Street.

302
0:28:53,200000 --> 0:28:55,200000
In Simeonovo you go to another place.

303
0:28:55,200000 --> 0:28:57,200000
Is it close?

304
0:28:57,200000 --> 0:28:59,200000
It is very close.

305
0:28:59,200000 --> 0:29:01,200000
It is very close by pedestrian distance.

306
0:29:01,200000 --> 0:29:06
We are talking about another small street, very narrow.

307
0:29:06,000000 --> 0:29:06,990000
We were talking about two addresses, Ivan Bogdanov street,

308
0:29:11,000000 --> 0:29:11,990000
two addresses that are practically one to another.

309
0:29:14,000000 --> 0:29:14,990000
You see a common fence.

310
0:29:16,000000 --> 0:29:16,990000
The head of the lion is in one house.

311
0:29:18,000000 --> 0:29:18,990000
Here is the lion.

312
0:29:20,000000 --> 0:29:20,990000
The house also looked empty, but when we turned around with the operator,

313
0:29:30,200000 --> 0:29:38,400000
a boy came out, because one of the smaller houses had doors and windows open.

314
0:29:38,400000 --> 0:29:50
You could see that the city was open. A young man came out to ask us what we were doing there.

315
0:29:50,000000 --> 0:29:50,990000
We told him that we were filming the street.

316
0:29:54,000000 --> 0:29:54,990000
And that's how the conversation started.

317
0:29:56,000000 --> 0:29:56,990000
You are on the street, you are not in the property.

318
0:29:58,000000 --> 0:29:58,990000
Exactly. We don't bother anyone.

319
0:30:00,000000 --> 0:30:00,990000
This property is one of the properties also identified by the protest network in 2013.

320
0:30:08,000000 --> 0:30:08,990000
What they discovered then is that old photos through Google, from which, when the car that was filming passed,

321
0:30:20,000000 --> 0:30:20,990000
the security was filmed in the security company by the labels.

322
0:30:28,000000 --> 0:30:28,990000
These are simple things that are done in such situations when you have no information, you are looking for details,

323
0:30:36,000000 --> 0:30:36,990000
some coincidences and they discover the connection that they later describe in their material. But they also don't have any information at the moment

324
0:30:48,000000 --> 0:30:48,990000
if the mother of Delian Peevski is living in this property,

325
0:30:53,000000 --> 0:30:53,990000
because the information they have at the moment is that she is abroad for the most time.

326
0:30:59,000000 --> 0:30:59,990000
So, so far we have properties that we showed, which according to the declaration of the Peevs and the history of his properties coincide with properties that he said he used for rent, that he lived there for rent, but there are no traces of a person living there currently.

327
0:31:18,640000 --> 0:31:19,520000
No, no.

328
0:31:19,520000 --> 0:31:28,400000
That's the way it is. But there are food boxes. You have to be prepared to have someone to meet you and send you food.

329
0:31:28,400000 --> 0:31:33
It's not just to call a call and say that you are looking for Mr. Peevski.

330
0:31:33,000000 --> 0:31:33,990000
These properties, to be more precise, are worth 126,000 and 28,000 leva for a year.

331
0:31:47,000000 --> 0:31:47,990000
And the first one was 219,000 leva?

332
0:31:51,000000 --> 0:31:51,990000
Yes, the first one was 219,000 leva.

333
0:31:54,000000 --> 0:31:54,990000
And the second one? I am sorry that I wrote them down.

334
0:31:56,000000 --> 0:31:56,990000
I know that you will sum them up. The second one was 126,000 leva and the third one was 28,000 leva.

335
0:32:00,000000 --> 0:32:00,990000
Now let me see if I can count without the calculator.

336
0:32:02,000000 --> 0:32:02,990000
And the third one was?

337
0:32:04,000000 --> 0:32:04,990000
28,000 leva. But we have another one. We will talk about it in a moment.

338
0:32:08,000000 --> 0:32:08,990000
Ok, but roughly speaking, we are at 370 000.

339
0:32:14,000000 --> 0:32:14,990000
Mr. Pevskiy declares that within one year he pays at least that much for rent.

340
0:32:21,000000 --> 0:32:21,990000
370 000.

341
0:32:23,000000 --> 0:32:23,990000
Ok, but how much more additional 155 000 levs?

342
0:32:26,000000 --> 0:32:26,990000
More than half a million, but we won't talk about that now.

343
0:32:30,000000 --> 0:32:30,990000
We won't talk about that, because these are only the four properties that we assume are connected to him.

344
0:32:40,000000 --> 0:32:40,990000
In total, there are nine properties declared, so we have to add some more amounts, which are not small at, plus the cars that are used for rent.

345
0:32:48,000000 --> 0:32:48,990000
I can't tell you the total amount, because I don't have the list, but the declaration is public.

346
0:32:55,000000 --> 0:32:55,990000
I'm trying to imagine it, that's why I kept quiet.

347
0:33:00,000000 --> 0:33:00,990000
If you use, regardless of whether you are a tenant or an owner, but you live in five places, in four, what kind of schedule do you need to use?

348
0:33:09,000000 --> 0:33:09,990000
I don't know, during the day, during the week?

349
0:33:11,000000 --> 0:33:11,990000
And you want to visit them all at the same time?

350
0:33:14,000000 --> 0:33:14,990000
Well, he has declared that, right? Within one year.

351
0:33:17,000000 --> 0:33:17,990000
Or maybe the declaration is not true.

352
0:33:21,000000 --> 0:33:21,990000
Okay, but we can speculate until the end of the world. In the Simeonovo district there were these two addresses, one has one property, the other two.

353
0:33:30,000000 --> 0:33:30,990000
But you went a little further, in another district, which is a little in the other direction, to Gorna Banya.

354
0:33:37,000000 --> 0:33:37,990000
What did you find there?

355
0:33:39,000000 --> 0:33:39,990000
For me, it was the most interesting there.

356
0:33:41,000000 --> 0:33:41,990000
Because if we talk about the Sarajevo, we are talking about a built-up street.

357
0:33:50,000000 --> 0:33:50,990000
A visible street with a barrier.

358
0:33:55,000000 --> 0:33:55,990000
At the moment, because it is like a T-shaped crossroad.

359
0:34:07,000000 --> 0:34:07,990000
It is located in a fence and there is a terrible view of the fields below.

360
0:34:16,000000 --> 0:34:16,990000
But there is nothing below. It looks like a hill.

361
0:34:21,000000 --> 0:34:21,990000
But I couldn't get in.

362
0:34:23,000000 --> 0:34:23,990000
It is a little higher, so you have a little more than the other person. Yes, I was a bit higher.

363
0:34:26,000000 --> 0:34:26,990000
I was not allowed to enter the house and not tell anyone that I was breaking the privacy of the person.

364
0:34:35,000000 --> 0:34:35,990000
I reached this barrier. If we stop the video here, what we see on the left is a property that we identified as probably connected to the Delean Pevski to use.

365
0:34:53,000000 --> 0:34:53,990000
You mean the first town and the big tree behind it?

366
0:34:56,000000 --> 0:34:56,990000
No, the property on the right.

367
0:34:58,000000 --> 0:34:58,990000
On the right side, yes.

368
0:34:59,000000 --> 0:34:59,990000
The house that you see. The left side, where you can see the trees and the greenery, is the other two properties,

369
0:35:07,600000 --> 0:35:13,400000
which are very interesting, of Nikola and Hristo Krstevi.

370
0:35:13,400000 --> 0:35:15,400000
I assume they don't tell you anything about them.

371
0:35:15,400000 --> 0:35:20,600000
They are not rare names, Nikola and Hristo, but there are many people who say that they are from Krstevi.

372
0:35:20,600000 --> 0:35:28,800000
Yes, but Hristo Krstev is the owner of the company Oline His son Nikola was a member of the 45th National Assembly.

373
0:35:28,800000 --> 0:35:30,800000
You are talking about Mayoneza, right?

374
0:35:30,800000 --> 0:35:45,300000
Yes.

375
0:35:45,300000 --> 0:35:47,300000
In the neighborhood.

376
0:35:47,300000 --> 0:35:50,800000
This property with the barrier,

377
0:35:50,800000 --> 0:35:55,600000
this street is actually municipal.

378
0:35:55,600000 --> 0:35:58,600000
At least in the register it appears as property.

379
0:35:58,600000 --> 0:36:01,600000
It shouldn't be over-stayed in any way.

380
0:36:01,600000 --> 0:36:06
If it is over-stayed, there should be some kind of permission from the municipality.

381
0:36:06,000000 --> 0:36:06,990000
I admit that I didn't get there because we didn't have enough time to ask the municipality.

382
0:36:13,000000 --> 0:36:13,990000
Can it be over-stayed? Can it not?

383
0:36:15,000000 --> 0:36:15,990000
But there are municipality advisors who are active at the moment who could ask such questions and understand.

384
0:36:23,000000 --> 0:36:23,990000
They even have more tools to understand

385
0:36:25,000000 --> 0:36:25,990000
how much we have this street,

386
0:36:27,000000 --> 0:36:27,990000
whether it can be rebuilt.

387
0:36:29,000000 --> 0:36:29,990000
Our material is public, we don't know for how long.

388
0:36:31,000000 --> 0:36:31,990000
And this is clear, it is not something unknown.

389
0:36:36,000000 --> 0:36:36,990000
Behind is also another property,

390
0:36:43,000000 --> 0:36:43,990000
which is a municipal property. we are talking about a property that is intended for a second-class street,

391
0:36:50,000000 --> 0:36:50,990000
to which the property also has no access.

392
0:36:53,000000 --> 0:36:53,990000
But wait, before we get to this property, in the frames we show, we see a playground or a tennis court. What exactly is that? Tennis court. I thought it was a football field, but then I was drawn to the description.

393
0:37:08,000000 --> 0:37:08,990000
We are talking about tennis court.

394
0:37:11,000000 --> 0:37:11,990000
This tennis court is owned by Nikola Krstev, the former deputy of the team Atakav Narod.

395
0:37:23,000000 --> 0:37:23,990000
And all of this is behind the fence.

396
0:37:26,000000 --> 0:37:26,990000
So, we shouldn't imagine Dalyan Pevski playing tennis.

397
0:37:30,000000 --> 0:37:30,990000
That's what you're telling me now.

398
0:37:32,000000 --> 0:37:32,990000
I don't know, the neighbours can be invited to play tennis

399
0:37:35,000000 --> 0:37:35,990000
during their days off.

400
0:37:37,000000 --> 0:37:37,990000
I have no idea what sport they practice and love.

401
0:37:40,000000 --> 0:37:40,990000
And they can play whatever song they want, but that's a completely different topic.

402
0:37:44,000000 --> 0:37:44,990000
Don't provoke me. There's nothing else. And they can release any song they want, but that is a completely different topic.

403
0:37:45,000000 --> 0:37:45,990000
Don't provoke me.

404
0:37:46,000000 --> 0:37:46,990000
There is nothing else.

405
0:37:48,000000 --> 0:37:48,990000
I just wanted to tell you that there are more food stands there than in other places.

406
0:37:52,000000 --> 0:37:52,990000
Because there is one in the beginning and one a little bit more inside in the street, from the National Assembly, he will go to this place.

407
0:38:14,000000 --> 0:38:14,990000
The external sources say that he could be inhabited by a protected person.

408
0:38:20,000000 --> 0:38:20,990000
When I said that the National Assembly would leave it, we come to another interesting topic.

409
0:38:25,600000 --> 0:38:29,600000
But before that, I need some explanation.

410
0:38:29,600000 --> 0:38:41,600000
When you behave and live in this mysterious way, when we really try to find out where one of the leading politicians lives in Bulgaria and it is difficult to get to some answers,

411
0:38:41,600000 --> 0:38:46
it is normal to have all sorts of rumors, all sorts of speculations.

412
0:38:46,000000 --> 0:38:46,990000
We cannot confirm these rumors, but we have actually heard from the national representatives, who say, they really insist, they do not abandon the building of the National Assembly.

413
0:38:57,000000 --> 0:38:57,990000
What can this mean? We haven't seen it, because the access to the national cabinet in the former party house is not free for journalists.

414
0:39:08,420000 --> 0:39:13,880000
You have probably heard about it and seen it in a report on national TV.

415
0:39:13,880000 --> 0:39:26
But what was published a few months ago by the colleagues from OfNews is that the offices of the former communist leader Todor Zhivkov and one of his deputies Milko Balev,

416
0:39:26,000000 --> 0:39:26,990000
two offices that are close to each other in the building of the former party house,

417
0:39:31,000000 --> 0:39:31,990000
are occupied by the former prime minister Boiko Borisov and one of the DPS's presidents, Delian Peevski.

418
0:39:40,000000 --> 0:39:40,990000
These offices, what we know about them for many years, are not just a room with a small office and a small office for a secretary,

419
0:39:48,000000 --> 0:39:48,990000
but they also have something like small apartments, that is, a place where Todor Zhivkov and Milko Baliev could stay the night after late night work and sleep there.

420
0:39:59,000000 --> 0:39:59,990000
We have not seen all this with our own eyes, but the fact is that the people often use the term,

421
0:40:06,100000 --> 0:40:09,100000
and it doesn't leave the National Assembly.

422
0:40:09,100000 --> 0:40:11,100000
We are talking about Delian Peerski.

423
0:40:11,100000 --> 0:40:17,600000
I am sorry for this joke, it was a bit long, but maybe our viewers deserve to know this.

424
0:40:17,600000 --> 0:40:24,600000
Yes, this is information that we cannot prove, but it is a fact that a large part of the big offices,

425
0:40:24,600000 --> 0:40:25
so to say, were built during the rooms of the big guys, so to speak,

426
0:40:25,000000 --> 0:40:25,990000
were built during the communist period in these buildings,

427
0:40:29,000000 --> 0:40:29,990000
and that there is a special place for rest for every room.

428
0:40:35,000000 --> 0:40:35,990000
There are suits, they are used to dress up for different situations,

429
0:40:40,000000 --> 0:40:40,990000
there is a bed where they can rest. That is, some facilities have been created for the fact that it is assumed that these people spend a lot of time there,

430
0:40:52,000000 --> 0:40:52,990000
they come from meeting to meeting and such house amenities are necessary to be able to fulfill their official duties.

431
0:41:00,000000 --> 0:41:00,990000
So yes, not only there, but also in other buildings, in the Ministry Council, in the Party House,

432
0:41:06,000000 --> 0:41:06,990000
I mean the Ministry, there are similar types of rooms in the Cabinet.

433
0:41:13,000000 --> 0:41:13,990000
Okay, with this we can wrap up the topic and close it for now.

434
0:41:20,000000 --> 0:41:20,990000
We showed you quite specific places and we said several times why this is important and why we are doing it.

435
0:41:28,480000 --> 0:41:31,960000
Now, if we can go back to the beginning, to the Saray.

436
0:41:31,960000 --> 0:42:10
The only thing that is certain is that Ahmed Dogan, the honorable leader and one of the summer season he lived in the summer garden of the birth of the Sarajevo-Rosenets.

437
0:42:10,000000 --> 0:42:10,990000
But this one appeared in Boyana much earlier.

438
0:42:14,000000 --> 0:42:14,990000
I remember that in 2002-2003, when the Movement for Rights and Freedoms was for the first time a part of the government, the government between the NDP and the DPR,

439
0:42:26,600000 --> 0:42:32,800000
for the first time there were people from the DPR, ministers, many activists from the DPR came to Sofia from all over the country,

440
0:42:32,800000 --> 0:42:36,760000
because they took positions in the ministries' offices and so on.

441
0:42:36,760000 --> 0:42:42,800000
And then this building appeared, and then we were told by the journalists we were working with,

442
0:42:42,800000 --> 0:42:46,500000
who were following the work of the political parties,

443
0:42:46,500000 --> 0:42:53
that this is an academy, where young leaders of the movement for rights and freedoms will be trained.

444
0:42:53,000000 --> 0:42:53,990000
At one point the word hotel appeared again, but there has never been a hotel where you can ring the door and ask if there is room for one evening to stay here.

445
0:43:01,000000 --> 0:43:01,990000
There has never been such a case. He never stayed here. But since then it became known that Ahmed Dogan lived there.

446
0:43:07,000000 --> 0:43:07,990000
Even, I remember, at one point, Mrs. Emel Etem, the former right hand of Ahmed Dogan,

447
0:43:14,000000 --> 0:43:14,990000
I can confuse if I say if she was a deputy chairman or not, but she was always close to him, 20 years ago. Even she at one point invited only female colleagues to drink coffee and show them the sheds in Boyana.

448
0:43:35,000000 --> 0:43:35,990000
Unfortunately, I was from the other side, I didn't get the invitation and I didn't go there.

449
0:43:39,000000 --> 0:43:39,990000
I had to wait 20 years to see on these sheds look like from the inside.

450
0:43:46,000000 --> 0:43:46,990000
I assume you haven't been there either.

451
0:43:48,000000 --> 0:43:48,990000
I haven't been inside.

452
0:43:52,000000 --> 0:43:52,990000
But it was interesting for you.

453
0:43:54,000000 --> 0:43:54,990000
I saw the footage.

454
0:43:56,000000 --> 0:43:56,990000
The voyeurism is characteristic for everyone in such situations.

455
0:44:02,000000 --> 0:44:02,990000
We are not an aesthetic panel.

456
0:44:04,000000 --> 0:44:04,990000
We won't discuss whether it has taste or not, but the fact is that they are quite over-polluted,

457
0:44:10,000000 --> 0:44:10,990000
but it is about big and expensive buildings. Why was Dogan expelled? Aren't they his?

458
0:44:18,000000 --> 0:44:18,990000
How are things there in terms of ownership, who built it, who paid for it? They are not his, they have never been his.

459
0:44:26,680000 --> 0:44:30,760000
In the beginning they are a part of the tolerance association.

460
0:44:30,760000 --> 0:44:35,960000
This is a former building, it was in the original form,

461
0:44:35,960000 --> 0:44:37,960000
because it has nothing to do with the original form.

462
0:44:37,960000 --> 0:44:43,560000
As a resting base of the Ministry of Industry,

463
0:44:43,560000 --> 0:44:47,200000
or as some of the ministries have been called at that time.

464
0:44:47,200000 --> 0:44:54,920000
They transferred him to this association, which is an association for the DPS,

465
0:44:54,920000 --> 0:45:00,880000
because he is engaged in training and development of personnel, and so on.

466
0:45:00,880000 --> 0:45:11
They started to stop him. In fact, if we can say that at some point Dugan was the owner of this building,

467
0:45:11,000000 --> 0:45:11,990000
indirectly, this happens much later, when he becomes rich,

468
0:45:17,000000 --> 0:45:17,990000
in 2019, somewhere,

469
0:45:20,000000 --> 0:45:20,990000
when through a company company where he was working, he became the owner of the Saray in Boyan.

470
0:45:35,600000 --> 0:45:48,100000
When I asked Danil Papazov, because I had a communication with him about the basis of the project. You were the Minister of Transport in the government of Plamen Oresharski

471
0:45:48,100000 --> 0:45:51,400000
from the DPS Minister in 2013.

472
0:45:51,400000 --> 0:45:56
After that, you had a business with Dogan, a big business.

473
0:45:56,000000 --> 0:45:56,990000
They owned a company together, but at the time you were only the owner of Papazov.

474
0:46:00,200000 --> 0:46:10
Yes, they became partners at one point. When I asked him what was the reason for Dugan to release the building,

475
0:46:10,000000 --> 0:46:10,990000
he said that he no longer holds 70% of the company.

476
0:46:17,000000 --> 0:46:17,990000
We said that Sarayat belonged to Dugan for many years, but he is not on the map.

477
0:46:21,000000 --> 0:46:21,990000
In the end, he was kicked out of the company.

478
0:46:24,000000 --> 0:46:24,990000
I assume that the same with Rosenets are the same.

479
0:46:27,300000 --> 0:46:29,300000
It is the same in Rosenets.

480
0:46:29,300000 --> 0:46:33,300000
Dugan was never the owner there.

481
0:46:33,300000 --> 0:46:38,700000
He appears in the same way as a co-owner through a company.

482
0:46:38,700000 --> 0:46:43,900000
Whose property are the question buildings.

483
0:46:43,900000 --> 0:46:48
So this is not really Dugan.

484
0:46:48,000000 --> 0:46:48,990000
If I ask you where we lived in Dugan at the moment...

485
0:46:52,000000 --> 0:46:52,990000
I don't know where we lived in Dugan.

486
0:46:56,000000 --> 0:46:56,990000
I have no idea.

487
0:46:58,000000 --> 0:46:58,990000
We have two empty barns, several properties that we identified,

488
0:47:04,000000 --> 0:47:04,990000
which look like they are uninhab uninhabited than they do.

489
0:47:06,800000 --> 0:47:15,100000
We have a hotel where they sell apartments for 2000 euros per square meter, if someone is interested in repeating the price.

490
0:47:15,100000 --> 0:47:18,100000
And that's how things are. Thank you very much.

491
0:47:18,100000 --> 0:47:25
They are empty from the bottom of these buildings. We don't know who lives in them at the buildings and what is happening there.

492
0:47:25,000000 --> 0:47:25,990000
Exactly. We don't know. Did we forget something important?

493
0:47:30,000000 --> 0:47:30,990000
I think we went through the buildings that are connected to one person and the information we have. And again, for the 13th time probably, why do we believe it is important to talk about these stories?

494
0:47:52,000000 --> 0:47:52,990000
Because we are talking about politicians who will again on October 27th

495
0:47:56,000000 --> 0:47:56,990000
stand in front of the Bulgarian voters and seek trust in them,

496
0:47:59,000000 --> 0:47:59,990000
so that they can claim to rule Bulgaria.

497
0:48:03,000000 --> 0:48:03,990000
That is, the least they owe us, not the Genka, but to us as Bulgarian citizens, is to know something about them.

498
0:48:11,000000 --> 0:48:11,990000
Thank you very much, Genka, it was very nice of you.

499
0:48:14,000000 --> 0:48:14,990000

500
0:48:30,320000 --> 0:48:39,120000
