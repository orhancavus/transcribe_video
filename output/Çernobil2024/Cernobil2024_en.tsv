21000	26000	In April, 38 years ago, an accident occurred in the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl.
26000	31000	It has been identified as the heaviest in the history of nuclear power.
31000	33000	But the problem is not only that.
33000	38000	The communist government of Bulgaria hides the information about the incident.
38000	41000	While the people on the streets are protesting,
41000	44000	people are eating with a bright light on the salad.
44000	47000	The radioactive cloud is over Bulgaria.
47000	52000	The communist nomenclature drinks mineral water and eats tested food.
52000	55000	Who will change the measures against radiation?
55000	59000	We will talk to Professor Dmitar Vatsov from NoBulgarian University.
59000	63000	He is the author of the research on the archaeology of Moral Debilism.
63000	65000	Hello, Professor Vatsov.
65000	66000	Hello.
66000	68000	Let's start chronologically.
68000	70000	This event is happening.
70000	75000	Mira is even doing a quick research in the library.
75000	77000	A preview of the seal.
77000	79000	A preview of the seal.
79000	81000	How is this event reflected?
81000	85000	And since we are separating from it,
85000	88000	it is good to start chronologically.
88000	93000	How does it start and how do we understand in Bulgaria that such an accident happened?
95000	97000	For the accident in Chernobyl itself,
97000	100000	we understand from the workers' office,
100000	103000	if the first publication of April 28th is not wrong,
103000	106000	in which they say that the accident happened,
107000	112000	and they do not mention anything about any risks that the Bulgarian country faces.
112000	115000	In the next few days,
115000	117000	in two days,
117000	120000	the Atomic Energy Committee publishes again,
120000	123000	through the BTA and the workers' office,
123000	127000	a short message with which it explains that there is no danger to the population,
127000	129000	and so on until May 6th.
129000	131000	So, in fact, the government is hiding,
131000	134000	even though it knows perfectly well what is happening.
134000	137000	They are warned by the Soviet ambassador
137000	140000	about the testimony of the protection of Todor Zhivkov
140000	143000	a few days before the radioactive rain in Bulgaria,
143000	146000	that is, at the end of April itself.
146000	148000	The measurements of the radiation in the country
148000	151000	will begin on April 30th.
151000	154000	From May 1st and 2nd,
154000	156000	measures are taken,
156000	159000	full measures, full quarantine,
159000	162000	on food, water, nomenclature.
162000	165000	The nomenclature must be for the parties,
165000	168000	that is, the CKA of the BKP,
168000	171000	with the secretary and the Politburo,
171000	174000	and those positions in the country, including the government,
174000	177000	which are their preconditions.
177000	180000	These people are fully taken care of.
180000	183000	Even from the first days of the coming of the radiation,
183000	186000	the radiation comes here on May 1st and 2nd.
186000	189000	Because this is not a cloud that is evenly spreading everywhere,
189000	192000	it is overflowing with rain during this period,
192000	195000	between the first and the second,
195000	198000	and then the situation in Bulgaria becomes very difficult.
198000	201000	I am sure that there are three conditions
201000	204000	in Bulgaria at that time,
204000	207000	something like the state of Platonov.
207000	210000	From above are the tsars,
210000	213000	from below are the guards, as a second condition,
213000	216000	and from below are the peasants and the beggars.
216000	219000	From above is the nomenclature.
219000	222000	From below, with the words of the guards,
222000	225000	one of the soldiers, who were better protected,
225000	228000	and we will talk specifically about this,
228000	231000	from Kolko, the other population,
231000	234000	and Dubitaka, from which Obol was fed.
234000	237000	Dubitaka, from which Obol was fed,
237000	240000	in their steppes, they had independent steppes,
240000	243000	for the ecological food of the nomenclature,
243000	246000	Dubitaka drank deep-rooted water.
249000	252000	Water is one of the most important criteria.
252000	255000	The nomenclature drank mineral water
255000	258000	and drank deep-rooted water,
258000	261000	so that it was not infected.
261000	264000	Dubitaka, from the nomenclature,
264000	267000	drank deep-rooted water,
267000	270000	and the whole population drank water from sparks
271000	274000	The animals for Obol, for the special ones,
274000	277000	are placed at a higher level
277000	280000	compared to the population.
280000	283000	With the Bulgarians, yes.
283000	286000	The animals that give the milk and the meat
286000	289000	for the nomenclature are of the middle class,
289000	292000	they are of the higher class than the Bulgarian population.
292000	295000	Ten times less are the soldiers fed
295000	298000	thanks to the fact that their meat was sour.
298000	301000	Simply.
301000	304000	And thanks to the fact that the vegetables were washed.
304000	307000	On the other hand, however,
307000	310000	this is one of the shocking results of these measurements,
310000	313000	it turns out that one in ten years
313000	316000	is a very severe infection.
316000	319000	When they check why this happens,
319000	322000	it turns out that this is usually a cook,
322000	325000	the one who washes the products.
325000	328000	So, the difference is significant
328000	331000	between the amount of radiation
331000	334000	that the ordinary people and the soldiers
334000	337000	drank.
337000	340000	We can also say that there is a difference
340000	343000	in the amount of radiation that the research
343000	346000	of the people who were exposed to work
346000	349000	in the open were collected.
349000	352000	This is the case with the village-stopansky brigades,
352000	355000	the whole village-stopansky cycle,
355000	358000	probably such are the minors
358000	361000	who work in open quarries,
361000	364000	but there is no research for this.
364000	367000	There is research to calculate
367000	370000	the very high levels of radiation
370000	373000	of the brigades who worked in the pink valley.
373000	376000	The pink valley in May is one of the most severe
376000	379000	infections in Bulgaria.
379000	382000	There is a comparison between the people
382000	385000	from the pink valley who participated
385000	388000	in the pick-up.
388000	391000	They are both local and brigades
391000	394000	who were exposed there,
394000	397000	and people from Sofia.
397000	400000	Again, there are several times the difference
400000	403000	in the amount of radiation between those
403000	406000	who worked in the field and those who
406000	409000	worked in the field.
409000	412000	In Bulgaria alone we have a second
412000	415000	radiation peak.
415000	418000	In April-May-June 1987
418000	421000	the food in Bulgaria reaches the levels
421000	424000	of radiation higher than those
424000	427000	who were in May in 1986.
427000	430000	This second radiation peak is called
430000	433000	Bulgarian Chernobyl.
433000	436000	He is responsible for the fact
436000	439000	that, even though he was warned
439000	442000	many times by the same scientists,
442000	445000	the authorities are trying to use
445000	448000	in the winter of 1986 against 1987
448000	451000	the food for animals in May.
451000	454000	From here the milk and the meat
454000	457000	raise a lot of radioactivity.
457000	460000	It is possible to buy food from outside
460000	463000	but it is not possible.
463000	466000	According to their calculations,
466000	469000	about 30% of the Bulgarian population
469000	472000	comes from the consumption of radioactive
472000	475000	meat and milk a year after the accident.
475000	478000	That is, this is all intentional, all
478000	481000	conscious, but the leadership of the
481000	484000	Communist Party in Bulgaria then
484000	487000	decides to save money and not buy new
487000	490000	food.
490000	493000	That is, to save money with radioactive
493000	496000	meat, through animals and milk.
496000	499000	Exactly.
499000	502000	When you read the documents that
502000	505000	have been dealt with in the last few years
505000	508000	according to the Bulgarian Chernobyl
508000	511000	it is seen that the main motivation
511000	514000	of the authorities is not to buy food
514000	517000	because 450,000 children were at sea
517000	520000	in May, June, July 1986.
520000	523000	At the camp.
523000	526000	365,000 brigadiers were killed
526000	529000	in the summer.
529000	532000	Almost 800,000 young people
532000	535000	were subjected to heavy radiation.
535000	538000	This is something when you see
538000	541000	it has not been reported anywhere,
541000	544000	but it is seen that the basic
544000	547000	argument for this is that there is no
547000	550000	economic damage. First, there is no one to
550000	553000	collect the harvest, and for the children's camps
553000	556000	there is a special fear that they will lose
556000	559000	the aliens of the sea from the hard waves
559000	562000	if it is heard that there is radiation
562000	565000	on the sea shores.
565000	568000	In your reading, I think that where you
568000	571000	read the document, it is mentioned
571000	574000	that this is one of the reasons
574000	577000	that it is not reported to the people
577000	580000	so as not to be heard and to destroy
580000	583000	the summer season. This is officially given
583000	586000	as evidence by one of the authorities
586000	589000	for tourism.
589000	592000	Yes, then the head of the Bulgarian
592000	595000	Association for Tourism Yodnik
595000	598000	has decided to go out in peace
598000	601000	so as not to be lost
601000	604000	as tourists.
604000	607000	Although there are a few communities
607000	610000	that say something to the population
610000	613000	to be protected in May 1986,
613000	616000	these communities usually end up
616000	619000	with the fact that the Black Sea is completely
619000	622000	clean and safe. At the same time,
622000	625000	there have been tests of sand in Evsinograd
625000	628000	from the beach of Bongalo, I think it was called.
628000	631000	This is the beach of the authorities.
631000	634000	And special disinfectant measures
634000	637000	of sand have been carried out there.
637000	640000	That is, you claim that the whole Black Sea
640000	643000	is clean, but you clean your beach.
643000	646000	In the documents that you have seen
646000	649000	from these meetings and protocols of the Central Committee,
649000	652000	what do you think is the genocidal
652000	655000	thing in relation to the people,
655000	658000	that they kill people in practice,
658000	661000	consciously, especially children,
661000	664000	young people and young people who
664000	667000	subconsciously blame them outside
667000	670000	in conditions in which they are unlikely to be?
670000	673000	One of the most impressive things,
673000	676000	I call it moral debilitation,
676000	679000	is that they do what they have to do,
679000	682000	they do it for themselves, they are completely rational
682000	685000	and at the same time refuse to do it for others
685000	688000	and do not seem to have a moral problem,
688000	691000	some kind of conscience.
691000	694000	In these documents I can not find
694000	697000	a point of excuse or regret.
697000	700000	There is a gap of about two weeks
700000	703000	in which half of the authorities admit
703000	706000	In fact, in this first interview of Shinderov,
706000	709000	which was ordered by Grigor Stoichkov,
709000	712000	this is proven, that is, it is possible
712000	715000	to get out of his rule together with Ivan Pandev,
715000	718000	the head of the then Nuclear Energy Committee.
718000	721000	Ivan Pandev, so to speak,
721000	724000	shamelessly lies that there is nothing,
724000	727000	Shinderov, however, with an endless sedative Tom,
727000	730000	manages to make it clear that it is good
730000	733000	that the children do not run in the rain
733000	736000	and it is good to wash more often.
736000	739000	These are the measures that recommend,
739000	742000	so with half of Shinderov in this TV interview,
742000	745000	to calm down the audience totally.
745000	748000	From May 7 to May 24,
748000	751000	when it turns out that there is nothing
751000	754000	and everything is over,
754000	757000	and there are several statements
757000	760000	in which it is mentioned that there should be
760000	763000	such elementary hygiene measures.
763000	766000	This is a period of some kind of opening
766000	769000	of information to the population,
769000	772000	but it is extremely minimal.
772000	775000	How did these messages pass on TV
775000	778000	or somewhere in the news?
778000	781000	On May 7, Shinderov's interview is on television,
781000	784000	in the only then Bulgarian television.
784000	787000	And on May 24, the message
787000	790000	in exchange for the measures was published
790000	793000	by the BTA and printed on all newspapers
793000	796000	and cited on television.
796000	799000	We have a very interesting picture on the wall.
799000	802000	Colleagues took out Mara Maleeva and Todor Zhivkov
802000	805000	on a banquet.
805000	808000	She is no longer alive, I think,
808000	811000	Mara Maleeva.
811000	814000	She was born in 1986.
814000	817000	Mrs. Maleeva.
817000	820000	The picture is illustrative.
820000	823000	Yes, but it shows
823000	826000	the trapeze of power.
826000	829000	The evidence shows
829000	832000	that in the residence
832000	835000	in Boyana,
835000	838000	not only the food was
838000	841000	thoroughly checked.
841000	844000	UBO was the only organization
844000	847000	that under the Institute
847000	850000	for Ranginology and Radiobiology
850000	853000	has a dosimeter, a spectrometer
853000	856000	that allows to check
856000	859000	every product on the spot.
859000	862000	What is UBO?
862000	865000	Security and Food Administration?
865000	868000	Security, from the secret police.
868000	871000	This is one of them,
871000	874000	which is responsible for the protection
874000	877000	of the party and state leaders.
877000	880000	And the second time, however,
880000	883000	it was responsible for their health
883000	886000	and for their luxury.
886000	889000	UBO was responsible for the food
889000	892000	of the party leaders.
892000	895000	They had a chemical laboratory
895000	898000	for chemical analysis,
898000	901000	a radio laboratory for radiation analysis
901000	904000	with temporary equipment.
904000	907000	This is an organization
907000	910000	that acts independently.
910000	913000	Its head was General Kashev,
913000	916000	who later, in 1986,
916000	919000	committed suicide
919000	922000	on May 1-2,
922000	925000	in order to control
925000	928000	the food and living conditions
928000	931000	of the higher party of the minority.
931000	934000	Not everyone has received
934000	937000	such care from UBO.
937000	940000	According to the stories of
940000	943000	Alexander Vezenkov,
943000	946000	there are about 9,000 of them
946000	949000	and only about 500-600 of them
949000	952000	are responsible for the care of UBO.
952000	955000	For the food of the party?
955000	958000	Yes, for the food of the party,
958000	961000	which they have at home.
961000	964000	They should not only go
964000	967000	to the special restaurants of UBO.
967000	970000	It is unimaginable,
970000	973000	the delivery to the house.
973000	976000	Many young people
976000	979000	cannot imagine
979000	982000	that you cannot order food outside.
982000	985000	They cannot imagine
985000	988000	what the hotels look like at the moment.
988000	991000	We have some photos
991000	994000	from the publications.
994000	997000	It is something unheard of
997000	1000000	for the whole of Europe
1000000	1003000	and the whole world.
1003000	1006000	In the Bulgarian newspapers
1006000	1009000	there are reports
1009000	1012000	about the shops
1012000	1015000	that will be opened on holidays.
1015000	1018000	There are also photos
1018000	1021000	when the sports festival will take place.
1021000	1024000	In 1927-1928
1024000	1027000	there is a small report
1027000	1030000	on the 27th of April
1030000	1033000	about the problems
1033000	1036000	with Libya, Managua and the village.
1036000	1039000	We are very worried
1039000	1042000	about what is happening to the people there.
1042000	1045000	There is nothing for Chernobyl on the front page.
1045000	1048000	This is a period that is very difficult
1048000	1051000	to be understood by people who have not lived it.
1051000	1054000	This is the case for most Bulgarians
1054000	1057000	who have not lived it.
1057000	1060000	I remember
1060000	1063000	the late Professor Ivai Luzhnepolski.
1063000	1066000	I had the chance to tell him
1066000	1069000	that he was in Cannes
1069000	1072000	at the Cannes Film Festival.
1072000	1075000	He asked his wife
1075000	1078000	to bring him the milk
1078000	1081000	from the village.
1081000	1084000	Why?
1084000	1087000	Because he said that in the restaurants
1087000	1090000	in France, one village
1090000	1093000	and one village came with a dosimeter
1093000	1096000	to show that it was not infected.
1096000	1099000	And here nobody knew.
1099000	1102000	Nobody knew, but he said strongly.
1102000	1105000	I will go back to what Oboe did.
1105000	1108000	There are total absurdities
1108000	1111000	that people in Sofia
1111000	1114000	walk on the streets in Vrana,
1114000	1117000	which is the capital of Oboe.
1117000	1120000	Local workers
1120000	1123000	are ordered to dig
1123000	1126000	and take off the upper layer
1126000	1129000	of the finger of the kukushkarnik
1129000	1132000	so that the cats can walk on clean ground
1132000	1135000	on an uninfected radioactive ground.
1135000	1138000	Again, in Vrana
1138000	1141000	the grass, which
1141000	1144000	was sown in the beginning of May,
1144000	1147000	is sown in Vrana.
1147000	1150000	Instead of being sown
1150000	1153000	because it is radioactive,
1153000	1156000	it is sold to the Serdika
1156000	1159000	livestock unit.
1159000	1162000	That is, it goes to feed the animals
1163000	1166000	Oboe for the nomenclature
1166000	1169000	buys a huge amount of
1169000	1172000	powder milk,
1172000	1175000	which they refuse to drink
1175000	1178000	because they rot,
1178000	1181000	but it stays with them for two months,
1181000	1184000	so that in fact the powder milk
1184000	1187000	does not reach the children's hospitals
1187000	1190000	and in the trade network there is
1190000	1193000	no production of the kukushkarnik
1193000	1196000	on a general basis.
1196000	1199000	After that, Oboe returns it,
1199000	1202000	but it was simply purified
1202000	1205000	temporarily just in case.
1205000	1208000	While others, while the people
1208000	1211000	and the children, especially in the children's gardens,
1211000	1214000	drink radioactive milk.
1214000	1217000	Such radioactive milk is released
1217000	1220000	in the spring of 1987
1220000	1223000	and there is not enough evidence.
1223000	1226000	They know that there is radiation,
1226000	1229000	because if the information flows,
1229000	1232000	they try to release information
1232000	1235000	and to take some measures,
1235000	1238000	they try through the so-called
1238000	1241000	circular national councils.
1241000	1244000	They were informed about what measures
1244000	1247000	they take, and they are very
1247000	1250000	striking, to control
1250000	1253000	the food for the children,
1253000	1256000	the milk and the meat,
1256000	1259000	how they control it.
1259000	1262000	Almost no production is released,
1262000	1265000	but it is mixed.
1265000	1268000	The meat is ground and it is mixed
1268000	1271000	very radioactive, with less radioactive
1271000	1274000	water.
1274000	1277000	But it is mixed.
1277000	1280000	We mix different types of milk
1280000	1283000	from different villages, which are
1283000	1286000	made in a large milk factory.
1286000	1289000	Is this documented?
1289000	1292000	Yes, it is.
1292000	1295000	How is the socialist language formulated?
1295000	1298000	These are instructions to the leaders
1298000	1301000	about the production of the milk,
1301000	1304000	the Bulgarian fruit for vegetables,
1304000	1307000	and so on.
1307000	1310000	But this is already a moment when
1310000	1313000	they know about the accidents and write
1313000	1316000	why these jokes are made.
1316000	1319000	How do you explain this?
1319000	1322000	Do you mix the milk from Sliven
1322000	1325000	with the milk from Blagoevgrad?
1325000	1328000	Yes.
1328000	1331000	The workers don't know.
1331000	1334000	They are probably suffering
1334000	1337000	because the radiation is released
1337000	1340000	in the cistern,
1340000	1343000	and the milk is mixed with the milk.
1343000	1346000	The milk is mixed with the milk
1346000	1349000	in the cistern,
1349000	1352000	and the milk is mixed with the milk.
1352000	1355000	The milk is mixed with the milk
1355000	1358000	because the radiation is released
1358000	1361000	in the cistern, in the machines, in the air.
1361000	1364000	But such research has not been done.
1364000	1367000	At least I have not come across such research.
1367000	1370000	And are the researches done,
1370000	1373000	in the end, how have they affected
1373000	1376000	the health of the population
1376000	1379000	for the next 10, 15, 20 years?
1379000	1382000	This medical expertise
1382000	1385000	allows us to make
1385000	1388000	probability calculations
1388000	1391000	for how many cancer diseases
1391000	1394000	will be due to the treatment,
1394000	1397000	how much cancer will be
1397000	1400000	due to the visible infection of J-131,
1400000	1403000	what malformations can be expected
1403000	1406000	during pregnancy,
1406000	1409000	and so on.
1409000	1412000	First of all,
1412000	1415000	the connection between the disease
1415000	1418000	and the radiation is not proven
1418000	1421000	to be the cause of the connection.
1421000	1424000	We cannot say that this person has cancer
1424000	1427000	thanks to radiation,
1427000	1430000	we do not know what cancer is caused by.
1430000	1433000	Therefore, the influence of radiation
1433000	1436000	can be expected
1436000	1439000	when this factor enters
1439000	1442000	among the factors that form the conditions
1442000	1445000	for cancer diseases.
1445000	1448000	And according to these calculations
1448000	1451000	of the medical expertise
1451000	1454000	from the beginning of the 90s,
1454000	1457000	from 50-60 to a few hundred,
1457000	1460000	500-600 people,
1460000	1463000	according to the study conducted
1463000	1466000	by the future government.
1466000	1469000	There is a lot of data,
1469000	1472000	but I do not know if anyone is serious
1472000	1475000	to gather them all together,
1475000	1478000	I hope we can do this
1478000	1481000	with collective effort to do it,
1481000	1484000	and to make a precise overall statistic
1484000	1487000	for how much radiation can be seen
1487000	1490000	in these diseases.
1490000	1493000	An American colleague
1493000	1496000	who is doing research on life expectancy
1496000	1499000	in Eastern Europe,
1499000	1502000	published a book in which something very strange is seen.
1502000	1505000	In the whole of Eastern Europe,
1505000	1508000	the so-called life expectancy is expected,
1508000	1511000	because it is again a statistical quantity.
1511000	1514000	It falls sharply after 1989,
1514000	1517000	many factors influence
1517000	1520000	and this is a common moment for Eastern Europe.
1520000	1523000	In Bulgaria it fell from 1987,
1523000	1526000	two years earlier.
1526000	1529000	What is the explanation for this?
1529000	1532000	Maybe one of the explanations is Chernobyl.
1544000	1547000	Today we thank our community.
