00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
In April, 38 years ago, an accident occurred in the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
It has been identified as the heaviest in the history of nuclear power.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
But the problem is not only that.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
The communist government of Bulgaria hides the information about the incident.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
While the people on the streets are protesting,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
people are eating with a bright light on the salad.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
The radioactive cloud is over Bulgaria.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
The communist nomenclature drinks mineral water and eats tested food.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Who will change the measures against radiation?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
We will talk to Professor Dmitar Vatsov from NoBulgarian University.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
He is the author of the research on the archaeology of Moral Debilism.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Hello, Professor Vatsov.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hello.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Let's start chronologically.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
This event is happening.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Mira is even doing a quick research in the library.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
A preview of the seal.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
A preview of the seal.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
How is this event reflected?

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
And since we are separating from it,

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
it is good to start chronologically.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
How does it start and how do we understand in Bulgaria that such an accident happened?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
For the accident in Chernobyl itself,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
we understand from the workers' office,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
if the first publication of April 28th is not wrong,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
in which they say that the accident happened,

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
and they do not mention anything about any risks that the Bulgarian country faces.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
In the next few days,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
in two days,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
the Atomic Energy Committee publishes again,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
through the BTA and the workers' office,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
a short message with which it explains that there is no danger to the population,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
and so on until May 6th.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So, in fact, the government is hiding,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
even though it knows perfectly well what is happening.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
They are warned by the Soviet ambassador

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
about the testimony of the protection of Todor Zhivkov

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
a few days before the radioactive rain in Bulgaria,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
that is, at the end of April itself.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
The measurements of the radiation in the country

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
will begin on April 30th.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
From May 1st and 2nd,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
measures are taken,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
full measures, full quarantine,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
on food, water, nomenclature.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
The nomenclature must be for the parties,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
that is, the CKA of the BKP,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
with the secretary and the Politburo,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
and those positions in the country, including the government,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
which are their preconditions.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
These people are fully taken care of.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Even from the first days of the coming of the radiation,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
the radiation comes here on May 1st and 2nd.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Because this is not a cloud that is evenly spreading everywhere,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
it is overflowing with rain during this period,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
between the first and the second,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and then the situation in Bulgaria becomes very difficult.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I am sure that there are three conditions

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
in Bulgaria at that time,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
something like the state of Platonov.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
From above are the tsars,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
from below are the guards, as a second condition,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and from below are the peasants and the beggars.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
From above is the nomenclature.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
From below, with the words of the guards,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
one of the soldiers, who were better protected,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
and we will talk specifically about this,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
from Kolko, the other population,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
and Dubitaka, from which Obol was fed.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Dubitaka, from which Obol was fed,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
in their steppes, they had independent steppes,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
for the ecological food of the nomenclature,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Dubitaka drank deep-rooted water.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Water is one of the most important criteria.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
The nomenclature drank mineral water

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
and drank deep-rooted water,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
so that it was not infected.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Dubitaka, from the nomenclature,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
drank deep-rooted water,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
and the whole population drank water from sparks

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
The animals for Obol, for the special ones,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
are placed at a higher level

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
compared to the population.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
With the Bulgarians, yes.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
The animals that give the milk and the meat

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
for the nomenclature are of the middle class,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
they are of the higher class than the Bulgarian population.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Ten times less are the soldiers fed

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
thanks to the fact that their meat was sour.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Simply.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And thanks to the fact that the vegetables were washed.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
On the other hand, however,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
this is one of the shocking results of these measurements,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
it turns out that one in ten years

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
is a very severe infection.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
When they check why this happens,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
it turns out that this is usually a cook,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
the one who washes the products.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
So, the difference is significant

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
between the amount of radiation

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
that the ordinary people and the soldiers

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
drank.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
We can also say that there is a difference

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
in the amount of radiation that the research

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
of the people who were exposed to work

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
in the open were collected.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
This is the case with the village-stopansky brigades,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
the whole village-stopansky cycle,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
probably such are the minors

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
who work in open quarries,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
but there is no research for this.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
There is research to calculate

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
the very high levels of radiation

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
of the brigades who worked in the pink valley.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
The pink valley in May is one of the most severe

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
infections in Bulgaria.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
There is a comparison between the people

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
from the pink valley who participated

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
in the pick-up.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
They are both local and brigades

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
who were exposed there,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
and people from Sofia.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Again, there are several times the difference

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
in the amount of radiation between those

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
who worked in the field and those who

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
worked in the field.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
In Bulgaria alone we have a second

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
radiation peak.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
In April-May-June 1987

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
the food in Bulgaria reaches the levels

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
of radiation higher than those

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
who were in May in 1986.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
This second radiation peak is called

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Bulgarian Chernobyl.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
He is responsible for the fact

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
that, even though he was warned

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
many times by the same scientists,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
the authorities are trying to use

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
in the winter of 1986 against 1987

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
the food for animals in May.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
From here the milk and the meat

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
raise a lot of radioactivity.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
It is possible to buy food from outside

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
but it is not possible.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
According to their calculations,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
about 30% of the Bulgarian population

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
comes from the consumption of radioactive

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
meat and milk a year after the accident.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
That is, this is all intentional, all

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
conscious, but the leadership of the

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Communist Party in Bulgaria then

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
decides to save money and not buy new

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
food.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
That is, to save money with radioactive

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
meat, through animals and milk.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Exactly.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
When you read the documents that

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
have been dealt with in the last few years

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
according to the Bulgarian Chernobyl

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
it is seen that the main motivation

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
of the authorities is not to buy food

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
because 450,000 children were at sea

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
in May, June, July 1986.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
At the camp.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
365,000 brigadiers were killed

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
in the summer.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Almost 800,000 young people

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
were subjected to heavy radiation.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
This is something when you see

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
it has not been reported anywhere,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
but it is seen that the basic

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
argument for this is that there is no

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
economic damage. First, there is no one to

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
collect the harvest, and for the children's camps

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
there is a special fear that they will lose

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
the aliens of the sea from the hard waves

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
if it is heard that there is radiation

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
on the sea shores.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
In your reading, I think that where you

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
read the document, it is mentioned

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
that this is one of the reasons

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
that it is not reported to the people

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
so as not to be heard and to destroy

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
the summer season. This is officially given

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
as evidence by one of the authorities

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
for tourism.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Yes, then the head of the Bulgarian

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Association for Tourism Yodnik

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
has decided to go out in peace

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
so as not to be lost

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
as tourists.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Although there are a few communities

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
that say something to the population

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
to be protected in May 1986,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
these communities usually end up

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
with the fact that the Black Sea is completely

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
clean and safe. At the same time,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
there have been tests of sand in Evsinograd

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
from the beach of Bongalo, I think it was called.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
This is the beach of the authorities.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And special disinfectant measures

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
of sand have been carried out there.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
That is, you claim that the whole Black Sea

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
is clean, but you clean your beach.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
In the documents that you have seen

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
from these meetings and protocols of the Central Committee,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
what do you think is the genocidal

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
thing in relation to the people,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
that they kill people in practice,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
consciously, especially children,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
young people and young people who

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
subconsciously blame them outside

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
in conditions in which they are unlikely to be?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
One of the most impressive things,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I call it moral debilitation,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
is that they do what they have to do,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
they do it for themselves, they are completely rational

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
and at the same time refuse to do it for others

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
and do not seem to have a moral problem,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
some kind of conscience.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
In these documents I can not find

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
a point of excuse or regret.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
There is a gap of about two weeks

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
in which half of the authorities admit

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
In fact, in this first interview of Shinderov,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
which was ordered by Grigor Stoichkov,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
this is proven, that is, it is possible

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
to get out of his rule together with Ivan Pandev,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
the head of the then Nuclear Energy Committee.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Ivan Pandev, so to speak,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
shamelessly lies that there is nothing,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Shinderov, however, with an endless sedative Tom,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
manages to make it clear that it is good

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
that the children do not run in the rain

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
and it is good to wash more often.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
These are the measures that recommend,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
so with half of Shinderov in this TV interview,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
to calm down the audience totally.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
From May 7 to May 24,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
when it turns out that there is nothing

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
and everything is over,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
and there are several statements

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
in which it is mentioned that there should be

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
such elementary hygiene measures.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
This is a period of some kind of opening

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
of information to the population,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
but it is extremely minimal.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
How did these messages pass on TV

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
or somewhere in the news?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
On May 7, Shinderov's interview is on television,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
in the only then Bulgarian television.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
And on May 24, the message

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
in exchange for the measures was published

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
by the BTA and printed on all newspapers

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
and cited on television.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
We have a very interesting picture on the wall.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Colleagues took out Mara Maleeva and Todor Zhivkov

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
on a banquet.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
She is no longer alive, I think,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Mara Maleeva.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
She was born in 1986.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Mrs. Maleeva.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
The picture is illustrative.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Yes, but it shows

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
the trapeze of power.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
The evidence shows

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
that in the residence

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
in Boyana,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
not only the food was

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
thoroughly checked.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
UBO was the only organization

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
that under the Institute

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
for Ranginology and Radiobiology

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
has a dosimeter, a spectrometer

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
that allows to check

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
every product on the spot.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
What is UBO?

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Security and Food Administration?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Security, from the secret police.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
This is one of them,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
which is responsible for the protection

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
of the party and state leaders.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And the second time, however,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
it was responsible for their health

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
and for their luxury.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
UBO was responsible for the food

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
of the party leaders.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
They had a chemical laboratory

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
for chemical analysis,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
a radio laboratory for radiation analysis

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
with temporary equipment.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
This is an organization

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
that acts independently.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Its head was General Kashev,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
who later, in 1986,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
committed suicide

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
on May 1-2,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
in order to control

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
the food and living conditions

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
of the higher party of the minority.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Not everyone has received

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
such care from UBO.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
According to the stories of

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Alexander Vezenkov,

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
there are about 9,000 of them

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
and only about 500-600 of them

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
are responsible for the care of UBO.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
For the food of the party?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Yes, for the food of the party,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
which they have at home.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
They should not only go

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
to the special restaurants of UBO.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
It is unimaginable,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
the delivery to the house.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Many young people

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
cannot imagine

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
that you cannot order food outside.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
They cannot imagine

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
what the hotels look like at the moment.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
We have some photos

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
from the publications.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It is something unheard of

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
for the whole of Europe

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
and the whole world.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
In the Bulgarian newspapers

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
there are reports

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
about the shops

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
that will be opened on holidays.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
There are also photos

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
when the sports festival will take place.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
In 1927-1928

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
there is a small report

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
on the 27th of April

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
about the problems

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
with Libya, Managua and the village.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
We are very worried

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
about what is happening to the people there.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
There is nothing for Chernobyl on the front page.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
This is a period that is very difficult

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
to be understood by people who have not lived it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
This is the case for most Bulgarians

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
who have not lived it.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I remember

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
the late Professor Ivai Luzhnepolski.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I had the chance to tell him

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
that he was in Cannes

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
at the Cannes Film Festival.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
He asked his wife

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
to bring him the milk

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
from the village.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Why?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Because he said that in the restaurants

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
in France, one village

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
and one village came with a dosimeter

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
to show that it was not infected.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
And here nobody knew.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Nobody knew, but he said strongly.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I will go back to what Oboe did.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
There are total absurdities

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
that people in Sofia

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
walk on the streets in Vrana,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
which is the capital of Oboe.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Local workers

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
are ordered to dig

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
and take off the upper layer

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
of the finger of the kukushkarnik

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
so that the cats can walk on clean ground

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
on an uninfected radioactive ground.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Again, in Vrana

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
the grass, which

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
was sown in the beginning of May,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
is sown in Vrana.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Instead of being sown

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
because it is radioactive,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
it is sold to the Serdika

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
livestock unit.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
That is, it goes to feed the animals

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Oboe for the nomenclature

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
buys a huge amount of

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
powder milk,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
which they refuse to drink

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
because they rot,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
but it stays with them for two months,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
so that in fact the powder milk

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
does not reach the children's hospitals

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
and in the trade network there is

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
no production of the kukushkarnik

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
on a general basis.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
After that, Oboe returns it,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
but it was simply purified

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
temporarily just in case.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
While others, while the people

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
and the children, especially in the children's gardens,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
drink radioactive milk.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Such radioactive milk is released

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
in the spring of 1987

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
and there is not enough evidence.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
They know that there is radiation,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
because if the information flows,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
they try to release information

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
and to take some measures,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
they try through the so-called

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
circular national councils.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
They were informed about what measures

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
they take, and they are very

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
striking, to control

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
the food for the children,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
the milk and the meat,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
how they control it.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Almost no production is released,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
but it is mixed.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
The meat is ground and it is mixed

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
very radioactive, with less radioactive

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
water.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
But it is mixed.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
We mix different types of milk

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
from different villages, which are

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
made in a large milk factory.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Is this documented?

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Yes, it is.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
How is the socialist language formulated?

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
These are instructions to the leaders

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
about the production of the milk,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
the Bulgarian fruit for vegetables,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
and so on.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
But this is already a moment when

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
they know about the accidents and write

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
why these jokes are made.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
How do you explain this?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Do you mix the milk from Sliven

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
with the milk from Blagoevgrad?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Yes.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
The workers don't know.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
They are probably suffering

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
because the radiation is released

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
in the cistern,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
and the milk is mixed with the milk.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
The milk is mixed with the milk

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
in the cistern,

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
and the milk is mixed with the milk.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
The milk is mixed with the milk

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
because the radiation is released

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
in the cistern, in the machines, in the air.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
But such research has not been done.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
At least I have not come across such research.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
And are the researches done,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
in the end, how have they affected

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
the health of the population

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
for the next 10, 15, 20 years?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
This medical expertise

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
allows us to make

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
probability calculations

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
for how many cancer diseases

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
will be due to the treatment,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
how much cancer will be

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
due to the visible infection of J-131,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
what malformations can be expected

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
during pregnancy,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
and so on.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
First of all,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
the connection between the disease

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and the radiation is not proven

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
to be the cause of the connection.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
We cannot say that this person has cancer

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
thanks to radiation,

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
we do not know what cancer is caused by.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Therefore, the influence of radiation

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
can be expected

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
when this factor enters

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
among the factors that form the conditions

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
for cancer diseases.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
And according to these calculations

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
of the medical expertise

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
from the beginning of the 90s,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
from 50-60 to a few hundred,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
500-600 people,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
according to the study conducted

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
by the future government.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
There is a lot of data,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
but I do not know if anyone is serious

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
to gather them all together,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
I hope we can do this

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
with collective effort to do it,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
and to make a precise overall statistic

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
for how much radiation can be seen

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
in these diseases.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
An American colleague

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
who is doing research on life expectancy

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
in Eastern Europe,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
published a book in which something very strange is seen.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
In the whole of Eastern Europe,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
the so-called life expectancy is expected,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
because it is again a statistical quantity.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
It falls sharply after 1989,

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
many factors influence

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
and this is a common moment for Eastern Europe.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
In Bulgaria it fell from 1987,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
two years earlier.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
What is the explanation for this?

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Maybe one of the explanations is Chernobyl.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Today we thank our community.
