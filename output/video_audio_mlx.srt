1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
How can we use the power of pictures at work?

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:17,120
How can you visualize what you think, what you know, and make that accessible for others to improve collaboration?

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,840
I have been obsessed with this question for 30 years, in 20 books, in 200 articles, in more than dozens of experiments.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,920
And what I found are amazing benefits that happen when you draw, when you use visualization software, when you sketch, when you doodle.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,400
You boost your creativity, you improve collaboration and communication of better conflicts.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,720
And you also improve your decision quality when you visualize the information that you have.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,600
But what I also found was that many of us don't use the potential of visualization at all.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,680
We stick to old ways of presenting of discussing.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Can I ask you this?

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,960
Who among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,880
Who loves to sit through that?

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,080
Okay, we have four people.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,400
For the rest, can you give me alternatives?

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
What can you do instead of bombarding people with slides?

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,760
What would be a visual way of working?

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
Storytelling, what else?

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,720
Prezi, yes, sketching, what else?

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,520
Mind mapping.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,080
Whiteboard, right?

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
There are many ways.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,400
When you invite people to visualize with you, to co-create what you're actually doing.

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
And this is the first of many visual metaphors to come.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,800
You're sort of laying out a mini red carpet to invite them to shine.

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,080
It's also a red threat that the conversation has.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
When you invite others to visualize with you.

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,840
So what I'd like to share in the next five to six minutes with you are three practices

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
that help you to invite others to visualize together.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
But first, can I take you back just a minute of my very first high-stake presentation?

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
Not as a university professor, but in my formal life as a consultant.

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,960
Client had asked us to analyze if they should enter a new multi-billion market.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,680
And we worked very hard to analyze this market.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
And I had produced about 40 data-driven slides to show the client that we had worked hard

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
and that he should not enter this business.

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,120
Just as I was ready to go and bombard the client with those slides,

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
my then boss said, Martin, take a seat.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,600
Hold your horses.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,320
And instead of me going through the slides, he showed the perplex audience one sketch.

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,960
One visual metaphor.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,160
And it was this one.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,480
It was a fortress built on sand.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,640
This guy had just summarized all of my 40 slides in a single image.

42
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Because he was right, this new market was like a fortress.

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
Very hard to conquer because of patent shields economies of scale contracts.

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,960
And he was not even worth conquering.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,440
It was sinking into the sand, so to speak,

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,400
because the technology was being replaced by another one.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,280
And of course, the client then asked about details like the patent analysis I had done

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,880
or the contracts and so forth.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,000
And I could show finally my slide with that analysis.

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,560
But this leading with a visual metaphor really changed the dynamics of the conversation.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,160
It was much more collaborative.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,960
First, you overview with this visual metaphor and then the details on demand.

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,920
And I realized it's all about a conversation.

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
It's much better this way.

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
When you first show overview with the help of a metaphor that by the way,

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,160
the client picked up and used also verbally.

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,480
And that caught me thinking as a researcher.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,120
And in many experiments with managers and student we found three practices

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,280
that I want to share with you that you can use to really reap the power of pictures professionally.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,720
And the first one, my chalk you,

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,880
especially the design of physiognodos among you.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,000
If you want visualization, graphic representations to work for you and for collaboration,

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
make them ugly.

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,560
Beauty is the enemy of collaboration.

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,200
If something looks too nice, it looks like it doesn't need revision or improvement.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,720
I call this the museum effect.

67
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,920
People just stared and said, yeah, that looks perfect.

68
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,280
And the thinking stops there.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
So you want to use the power of provisionality.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,760
You want to signal with your drawings.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,440
This is working progress.

72
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
And invite collaboration in this way.

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
So this is good news for all of us who are terrible at drawing.

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
So it's not a bug.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
It's a feature.

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,560
The technical term is low perceived or low perceived finishness.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
It looks provisional.

78
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,480
It invites collaboration.

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,520
And by the way, banks and telecom companies and

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
insurance has been using this all along.

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
It's called pencil selling.

82
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
When instead of using shiny slides,

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,920
you just sketch something with a pencil for a client, like a product.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,920
In our experiments, we're able to show this actually is much better.

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
It leads to more sales.

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
So if you want to harness the power of visualization for collaboration,

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,320
make them look ugly.

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
Make them look provisional.

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
You sketches and doodles.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,040
And we've shown in our experiments even little tweaks to software

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,360
to make it look more sketchy, boost collaboration and creativity.

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,400
And this brings me to the second advice I'd like to share with you.

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,880
Like my boss, lead with visual metaphors.

94
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
Don't just use diagrams, although they are powerful or charts or maps.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Visual metaphors are magical.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,040
They access what people already know.

97
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,640
They bring out new solution ideas.

98
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
They make things much more concrete, like a mini red carpet or a red thread.

99
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
Let me give you an example.

100
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
In a study that we originally did for BMW financial services and then published,

101
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,400
we used the identical strategy of BMW and communicated it to different staff members,

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
groups.

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
Once we used standard bullet points slides,

104
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,200
then we used a diagram.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And for the third group, we used the Mount Trail Visual metaphor with the same content

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
as the other two.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,600
And guess what?

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,040
For the group where we visualized through the mountain trail, the strategy,

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,240
not only did they remember a lot more, later on.

110
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,480
They were also much more motivated to implement the strategy.

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Now, I've never met a four I didn't like, but clearly not all metaphors are equally well suited.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,960
You want to make sure that the metaphor is simpler than what you're trying to explain,

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,760
that it's concrete and that people have a connection with it.

114
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,520
And that is hopefully the right connection.

115
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,520
I will never use again the volcano metaphor as I did once for creativity in a country that is

116
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,600
at risk of active volcanoes.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,240
So choose your metaphors well.

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
And if you do that, then it will resonate with people.

119
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
It will be much more memorable.

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
It sticks like a red ribbon on the floor.

121
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
Here's another example of such a visual metaphor.

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,480
It can come from nature, it can come from technology, it can come from mythology,

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
you name it here.

124
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,560
I used the bridge to visualize a few, I'm a professor of communications management,

125
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
a few communication problems.

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,760
And so it's simple, also visually, and the beauty of this kind of visual,

127
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,200
we can learn that from comic strips is that it starts a series that people then want to complete.

128
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,760
And I think that's very powerful in collaboration.

129
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,080
I call this third practice that I want to share with you in conclusion.

130
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
I call this visual variation.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,200
You use a metaphor or a diagram and then you vary it, you repeat it, but slightly differently.

132
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,240
And the magic that this does for collaboration is people start to extend the series you're giving them.

133
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
So for example, here communication is one side because of a lack of listening,

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,520
right? One way street or the bridge is not aligned, there's misunderstandings or it's too full.

135
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,320
The too many messages crowd out the key message.

136
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,720
And people automatically think of other communication problems through the metaphor of the bridge.

137
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,920
Like one car going off, the bridge maybe because the person is too emotional, right?

138
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,840
Or the bridge being shaky, maybe because there's no trust in the relationship.

139
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,320
Visual metaphors spark the imagination, especially if they come in a series of images.

140
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
This is by the way a very empirically validated,

141
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,240
theory it's called variation theory.

142
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,040
And it basically says that you do not understand anything

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,640
until you understand it in more than one way.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,880
And so if you ask me for advice how to make visuals more part of your everyday work,

145
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,160
I would say, start a series, start a simple image, it doesn't have to be sophisticated and invite others

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,560
to build on that. Here's my final example for that.

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,160
As a university professor, we often advise students and many of our students still have this stereotypical

148
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,200
career path in mind that it only goes upward in terms of salary or hierarchy.

149
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
And I drew this visual variation to invite them to think about alternative career trajectory.

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,360
So the career year doesn't have to be linear. In fact, I find I don't know how about you

151
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,840
that the most intriguing careers are often non-linear.

152
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
Are different than this upward staircase model.

153
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,440
So in conclusion, go forth and visualize or vanish use the power of pictures.

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,440
And when you do that, you will see it boost your creativity, it improves the session,

155
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,240
especially if you use images that signal that they are working progress,

156
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,000
that invite others like a carpet to rent carpet to shine together, to co-create

157
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,440
something new together. Especially if you don't just rely on abstract diagrams or charts,

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,760
but use the power of visual metaphors to activate what people already know.

159
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,960
And thirdly, of course, if you don't just use a single image and overload that one,

160
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,520
but start a sequence that your colleagues can build upon. Thank you very much.
