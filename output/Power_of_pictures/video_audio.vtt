00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
How can we use the power of pictures at work?

00:08.800 --> 00:14.800
How can you visualize what you think, what you know, and make that accessible for others

00:14.800 --> 00:17.120
to improve collaboration?

00:17.120 --> 00:22.960
I have been obsessed with this question for 30 years, in 20 books, in 200 articles, in

00:22.960 --> 00:25.980
more than dozens of experiments.

00:25.980 --> 00:31.740
And what I found are amazing benefits that happen when you draw, when you use visualization

00:31.740 --> 00:34.100
software, when you sketch, when you doodle.

00:34.100 --> 00:40.740
You boost your creativity, you improve collaboration and communication of better conflicts, and

00:40.740 --> 00:46.940
you also improve your decision quality when you visualize the information that you have.

00:46.940 --> 00:52.460
But what I also found was that many of us don't use the potential of visualization at

00:52.460 --> 00:53.780
all.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.900
We stick to old ways of presenting, of discussing.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.900
Can I ask you this?

00:59.900 --> 01:05.100
Who among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?

01:05.100 --> 01:06.820
Who loves to sit through that?

01:06.820 --> 01:10.740
Okay, we have four people.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.580
For the rest, can you give me alternatives?

01:12.580 --> 01:15.460
What can you do instead of bombarding people with slides?

01:15.460 --> 01:18.660
What would be a visual way of working?

01:18.660 --> 01:20.900
Storytelling, what else?

01:20.900 --> 01:21.900
Prezi.

01:21.900 --> 01:22.900
Prezi.

01:23.020 --> 01:24.340
Just sketching.

01:24.340 --> 01:25.340
What else?

01:25.340 --> 01:26.340
Mind mapping.

01:26.340 --> 01:27.340
Whiteboard.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.340
Right?

01:28.340 --> 01:33.700
There are many ways when you invite people to visualize with you, to co-create what you're

01:33.700 --> 01:37.820
actually doing, and this is the first of many visual metaphors to come, you're sort of laying

01:37.820 --> 01:45.800
out a mini red carpet to invite them to shine.

01:45.800 --> 01:53.200
It's also a red thread that the conversation has when you invite others to visualize with

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
you.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.880
So what I'd like to share in the next five to six minutes with you are three practices

01:57.880 --> 02:04.280
that help you to invite others to visualize together.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.760
But first, can I take you back just a minute to my very first high-stake presentation,

02:08.760 --> 02:15.040
not as a university professor, but in my former life as a consultant.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.200
My client had asked us to analyze if they should enter a new multi-billion market, and

02:19.200 --> 02:24.720
we worked very hard to analyze this market, and I had produced about 40 data-driven slides

02:24.720 --> 02:30.960
to show the client that we had worked hard and that he should not enter this business.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.800
Just as I was ready to go and bombard the client with those slides, my then boss said,

02:36.800 --> 02:39.000
Martin, take a seat.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.920
Hold your horses.

02:40.920 --> 02:47.520
And instead of me going through the slides, he showed the perplexed audience one sketch,

02:47.520 --> 02:50.360
one visual metaphor, and it was this one.

02:50.360 --> 02:54.380
It was a fortress built on sand.

02:54.380 --> 02:59.880
This guy had just summarized all of my 40 slides in a single image because he was right.

02:59.880 --> 03:05.360
This new market was like a fortress, very hard to conquer because of patent shields,

03:05.360 --> 03:09.120
economies of scale contracts, and it was not even worth conquering.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.680
It was sinking into the sand, so to speak, because the technology was being replaced

03:13.680 --> 03:15.520
by another one.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.320
And of course, the client then asked about details like the patent analysis I had done

03:19.320 --> 03:24.400
or the contracts and so forth, and I could show finally my slide with that analysis.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.680
But this leading with a visual metaphor really changed the dynamics of the conversation.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.480
It was much more collaborative.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.680
First the overview with this visual metaphor, and then the details on demand.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.120
And I realized it's all about a conversation.

03:40.120 --> 03:44.200
It's much better this way when you first show overview with the help of a metaphor that,

03:44.200 --> 03:48.360
by the way, the client picked up and used also verbally.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.840
And that got me thinking as a researcher.

03:50.840 --> 03:55.400
And in many experiments with managers and students, we found three practices that I

03:55.400 --> 04:02.440
want to share with you that you can use to really reap the power of pictures professionally.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.280
And the first one might shock you.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.040
Especially the design aficionados among you.

04:11.040 --> 04:17.320
If you want visualization, graphic representations to work for you and for collaboration, make

04:17.320 --> 04:20.800
them ugly.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.640
Beauty is the enemy of collaboration.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.240
If something looks too nice, it looks like it doesn't need revision or improvement.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.560
I call this the museum effect.

04:29.560 --> 04:34.380
People just stare and say, yeah, that looks perfect, and the thinking stops there.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.800
So you want to use the power of provisionality.

04:37.800 --> 04:42.860
You want to signal with your drawings, this is work in progress, and invite collaboration

04:42.860 --> 04:43.860
in this way.

04:43.860 --> 04:47.280
So this is good news for all of us who are terrible at drawing.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.840
So it's not a bug, it's a feature.

04:49.840 --> 04:54.840
The technical term is low perceived finishness.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.280
It looks provisional.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.620
It invites collaboration.

04:58.620 --> 05:04.080
And by the way, banks and telecom companies and insurances have been using this all along.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.160
It's called pencil selling, when instead of using shiny slides, you just sketch something

05:09.160 --> 05:12.560
with a pencil for a client, like a product.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.320
In our experiments, we were able to show this actually is much better, leads to more sales.

05:17.320 --> 05:23.320
So if you want to harness the power of visualization for collaboration, make them look ugly.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.420
Make them look provisional.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.040
Use sketches and doodles.

05:26.040 --> 05:31.640
And we've shown in our experiments even little tweaks to software to make it look more sketchy,

05:31.640 --> 05:35.200
boosts collaboration and creativity.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.880
And this brings me to the second advice I'd like to share with you.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.780
Like my boss, lead with visual metaphors.

05:43.780 --> 05:49.040
Don't just use diagrams, although they are powerful, or charts or maps.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.520
Visual metaphors are magical.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.380
They access what people already know.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.560
They bring out new solution ideas.

05:57.560 --> 06:02.840
They make things much more concrete, like a mini red carpet or a red thread.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.260
Let me give you an example.

06:04.260 --> 06:08.840
In a study that we originally did for BMW financial services and then published, we

06:08.840 --> 06:17.640
used the identical strategy of BMW and communicated it to different staff members, groups.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.320
Once we used standard bullet point slides, then we used a diagram.

06:22.320 --> 06:28.000
And for the third group, we used the mountain trail visual metaphor with the same content

06:28.000 --> 06:29.040
as the other two.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.700
And guess what?

06:30.700 --> 06:35.520
For the group where we visualized through the mountain trail the strategy, not only

06:35.520 --> 06:41.800
did they remember a lot more later on, they were also much more motivated to implement

06:41.800 --> 06:44.120
the strategy.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.600
Now I've never met a four I didn't like, but clearly not all metaphors are equally

06:49.600 --> 06:50.700
well suited.

06:50.700 --> 06:55.180
You want to make sure that the metaphor is simpler than what you're trying to explain,

06:55.180 --> 06:58.780
that it's concrete and that people have a connection with it, and that is hopefully

06:58.780 --> 06:59.780
the right connection.

06:59.780 --> 07:04.780
I will never use again the volcano metaphor as I did once for creativity in a country

07:04.780 --> 07:07.820
that is at risk of active volcanoes.

07:07.820 --> 07:13.640
So choose your metaphors well, and if you do that, then it will resonate with people.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.440
It will be much more memorable.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.660
It sticks like a red ribbon on the floor.

07:18.660 --> 07:22.460
Here's another example of such a visual metaphor.

07:22.460 --> 07:26.620
It can come from nature, it can come from technology, it can come from mythology, you

07:26.620 --> 07:27.620
name it.

07:27.620 --> 07:32.620
Here I used the bridge to visualize a few, I'm a professor of communications management,

07:32.620 --> 07:35.780
a few communication problems.

07:35.780 --> 07:38.500
And so it's simple, also visually.

07:38.500 --> 07:46.100
And the beauty of this kind of visual, we can learn that from comic strips, is that

07:46.260 --> 07:51.020
it starts a series that people then want to complete, and I think that's very powerful

07:51.020 --> 07:52.020
in collaboration.

07:52.020 --> 07:56.920
I call this third practice that I want to share with you in conclusion, I call this

07:56.920 --> 07:59.320
visual variation.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.800
You use a metaphor or a diagram, and then you vary it.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.460
You repeat it, but slightly differently.

08:05.460 --> 08:09.620
And the magic that this does for collaboration is people start to extend the series you're

08:09.620 --> 08:10.620
giving them.

08:10.620 --> 08:15.860
So for example here, communication is one-sided because of a lack of listening, right?

08:15.860 --> 08:21.700
One-way street, or the bridge is not aligned, there's misunderstandings, or it's too full,

08:21.700 --> 08:24.580
the too many messages crowd out, the key message.

08:24.580 --> 08:28.820
And people automatically think of other communication problems through the metaphor of the bridge.

08:28.820 --> 08:34.120
Like one car going off the bridge, maybe because the person is too emotional, right?

08:34.120 --> 08:38.760
Or the bridge being shaky, maybe because there's no trust in the relationship.

08:38.760 --> 08:47.640
Two metaphors spark the imagination, especially if they come in a series of images.

08:47.640 --> 08:54.600
This is, by the way, a very empirically validated theory, it's called variation theory, and

08:54.600 --> 09:00.280
it basically says that you do not understand anything until you understand it in more than

09:00.280 --> 09:01.880
one way.

09:01.880 --> 09:07.120
And so if you ask me for advice how to make visuals more part of your everyday work, I

09:07.600 --> 09:11.880
would say start a series, start a simple image, it doesn't have to be sophisticated, and invite

09:11.880 --> 09:15.080
others to build on that.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.040
Here is my final example for that.

09:18.040 --> 09:24.280
As university professor we often advise students, and many of our students still have this stereotypical

09:24.280 --> 09:29.600
career path in mind that it only goes upward in terms of salary or hierarchy, and I drew

09:29.600 --> 09:34.520
this visual variation to invite them to think about alternative career trajectories, so

09:34.520 --> 09:36.440
the career doesn't have to be linear.

09:36.440 --> 09:43.200
In fact, I find, I don't know how about you, that the most intriguing careers are often

09:43.200 --> 09:50.040
non-linear, are different than this upward staircase model.

09:50.040 --> 09:55.960
So in conclusion, go forth and visualize or vanish, use the power of pictures, and when

09:55.960 --> 10:02.160
you do that you will see it boosts your creativity, it improves decisions, especially if you use

10:02.160 --> 10:06.880
images that signal that they are work in progress, that invite others, like a carpet

10:06.880 --> 10:13.680
to, a red carpet to shine together, to co-create something new together.

10:13.680 --> 10:19.360
Especially if you don't just rely on abstract diagrams or charts, but use the power of visual

10:19.360 --> 10:22.680
metaphors to activate what people already know.

10:22.680 --> 10:27.320
And thirdly, of course, if you don't just use a single image and overload that one,

10:27.320 --> 10:31.080
but start a sequence that your colleagues can build upon.

10:31.080 --> 10:31.680
Thank you very much.
