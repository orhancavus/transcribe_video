1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
How can we use the power of pictures at work?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,800
How can you visualize what you think, what you know, and make that accessible for others

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,120
to improve collaboration?

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,960
I have been obsessed with this question for 30 years, in 20 books, in 200 articles, in

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,980
more than dozens of experiments.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,740
And what I found are amazing benefits that happen when you draw, when you use visualization

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,100
software, when you sketch, when you doodle.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,740
You boost your creativity, you improve collaboration and communication of better conflicts, and

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,940
you also improve your decision quality when you visualize the information that you have.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,460
But what I also found was that many of us don't use the potential of visualization at

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,780
all.

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,900
We stick to old ways of presenting, of discussing.

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
Can I ask you this?

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,100
Who among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,820
Who loves to sit through that?

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,740
Okay, we have four people.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,580
For the rest, can you give me alternatives?

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,460
What can you do instead of bombarding people with slides?

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,660
What would be a visual way of working?

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,900
Storytelling, what else?

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Prezi.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Prezi.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,340
Just sketching.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,340
What else?

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
Mind mapping.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Whiteboard.

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
Right?

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,700
There are many ways when you invite people to visualize with you, to co-create what you're

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,820
actually doing, and this is the first of many visual metaphors to come, you're sort of laying

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:45,800
out a mini red carpet to invite them to shine.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,200
It's also a red thread that the conversation has when you invite others to visualize with

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
you.

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,880
So what I'd like to share in the next five to six minutes with you are three practices

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,280
that help you to invite others to visualize together.

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,760
But first, can I take you back just a minute to my very first high-stake presentation,

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,040
not as a university professor, but in my former life as a consultant.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
My client had asked us to analyze if they should enter a new multi-billion market, and

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
we worked very hard to analyze this market, and I had produced about 40 data-driven slides

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,960
to show the client that we had worked hard and that he should not enter this business.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Just as I was ready to go and bombard the client with those slides, my then boss said,

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
Martin, take a seat.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,920
Hold your horses.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,520
And instead of me going through the slides, he showed the perplexed audience one sketch,

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,360
one visual metaphor, and it was this one.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,380
It was a fortress built on sand.

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,880
This guy had just summarized all of my 40 slides in a single image because he was right.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,360
This new market was like a fortress, very hard to conquer because of patent shields,

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
economies of scale contracts, and it was not even worth conquering.

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,680
It was sinking into the sand, so to speak, because the technology was being replaced

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
by another one.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,320
And of course, the client then asked about details like the patent analysis I had done

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,400
or the contracts and so forth, and I could show finally my slide with that analysis.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,680
But this leading with a visual metaphor really changed the dynamics of the conversation.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,480
It was much more collaborative.

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,680
First the overview with this visual metaphor, and then the details on demand.

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,120
And I realized it's all about a conversation.

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,200
It's much better this way when you first show overview with the help of a metaphor that,

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,360
by the way, the client picked up and used also verbally.

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,840
And that got me thinking as a researcher.

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,400
And in many experiments with managers and students, we found three practices that I

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,440
want to share with you that you can use to really reap the power of pictures professionally.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,280
And the first one might shock you.

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,040
Especially the design aficionados among you.

64
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,320
If you want visualization, graphic representations to work for you and for collaboration, make

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,800
them ugly.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,640
Beauty is the enemy of collaboration.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,240
If something looks too nice, it looks like it doesn't need revision or improvement.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,560
I call this the museum effect.

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,380
People just stare and say, yeah, that looks perfect, and the thinking stops there.

70
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,800
So you want to use the power of provisionality.

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,860
You want to signal with your drawings, this is work in progress, and invite collaboration

72
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
in this way.

73
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,280
So this is good news for all of us who are terrible at drawing.

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,840
So it's not a bug, it's a feature.

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,840
The technical term is low perceived finishness.

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,280
It looks provisional.

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,620
It invites collaboration.

78
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,080
And by the way, banks and telecom companies and insurances have been using this all along.

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,160
It's called pencil selling, when instead of using shiny slides, you just sketch something

80
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,560
with a pencil for a client, like a product.

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,320
In our experiments, we were able to show this actually is much better, leads to more sales.

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,320
So if you want to harness the power of visualization for collaboration, make them look ugly.

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,420
Make them look provisional.

84
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,040
Use sketches and doodles.

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,640
And we've shown in our experiments even little tweaks to software to make it look more sketchy,

86
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,200
boosts collaboration and creativity.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,880
And this brings me to the second advice I'd like to share with you.

88
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,780
Like my boss, lead with visual metaphors.

89
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,040
Don't just use diagrams, although they are powerful, or charts or maps.

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
Visual metaphors are magical.

91
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,380
They access what people already know.

92
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,560
They bring out new solution ideas.

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,840
They make things much more concrete, like a mini red carpet or a red thread.

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,260
Let me give you an example.

95
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,840
In a study that we originally did for BMW financial services and then published, we

96
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:17,640
used the identical strategy of BMW and communicated it to different staff members, groups.

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,320
Once we used standard bullet point slides, then we used a diagram.

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,000
And for the third group, we used the mountain trail visual metaphor with the same content

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
as the other two.

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,700
And guess what?

101
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,520
For the group where we visualized through the mountain trail the strategy, not only

102
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,800
did they remember a lot more later on, they were also much more motivated to implement

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,120
the strategy.

104
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Now I've never met a four I didn't like, but clearly not all metaphors are equally

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,700
well suited.

106
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,180
You want to make sure that the metaphor is simpler than what you're trying to explain,

107
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,780
that it's concrete and that people have a connection with it, and that is hopefully

108
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,780
the right connection.

109
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I will never use again the volcano metaphor as I did once for creativity in a country

110
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,820
that is at risk of active volcanoes.

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,640
So choose your metaphors well, and if you do that, then it will resonate with people.

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,440
It will be much more memorable.

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,660
It sticks like a red ribbon on the floor.

114
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,460
Here's another example of such a visual metaphor.

115
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,620
It can come from nature, it can come from technology, it can come from mythology, you

116
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
name it.

117
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,620
Here I used the bridge to visualize a few, I'm a professor of communications management,

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,780
a few communication problems.

119
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,500
And so it's simple, also visually.

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:46,100
And the beauty of this kind of visual, we can learn that from comic strips, is that

121
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,020
it starts a series that people then want to complete, and I think that's very powerful

122
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
in collaboration.

123
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,920
I call this third practice that I want to share with you in conclusion, I call this

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
visual variation.

125
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,800
You use a metaphor or a diagram, and then you vary it.

126
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,460
You repeat it, but slightly differently.

127
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,620
And the magic that this does for collaboration is people start to extend the series you're

128
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
giving them.

129
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,860
So for example here, communication is one-sided because of a lack of listening, right?

130
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,700
One-way street, or the bridge is not aligned, there's misunderstandings, or it's too full,

131
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,580
the too many messages crowd out, the key message.

132
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,820
And people automatically think of other communication problems through the metaphor of the bridge.

133
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,120
Like one car going off the bridge, maybe because the person is too emotional, right?

134
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,760
Or the bridge being shaky, maybe because there's no trust in the relationship.

135
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:47,640
Two metaphors spark the imagination, especially if they come in a series of images.

136
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,600
This is, by the way, a very empirically validated theory, it's called variation theory, and

137
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,280
it basically says that you do not understand anything until you understand it in more than

138
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,880
one way.

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,120
And so if you ask me for advice how to make visuals more part of your everyday work, I

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,880
would say start a series, start a simple image, it doesn't have to be sophisticated, and invite

141
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,080
others to build on that.

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,040
Here is my final example for that.

143
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,280
As university professor we often advise students, and many of our students still have this stereotypical

144
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,600
career path in mind that it only goes upward in terms of salary or hierarchy, and I drew

145
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,520
this visual variation to invite them to think about alternative career trajectories, so

146
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,440
the career doesn't have to be linear.

147
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,200
In fact, I find, I don't know how about you, that the most intriguing careers are often

148
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,040
non-linear, are different than this upward staircase model.

149
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,960
So in conclusion, go forth and visualize or vanish, use the power of pictures, and when

150
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,160
you do that you will see it boosts your creativity, it improves decisions, especially if you use

151
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
images that signal that they are work in progress, that invite others, like a carpet

152
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,680
to, a red carpet to shine together, to co-create something new together.

153
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,360
Especially if you don't just rely on abstract diagrams or charts, but use the power of visual

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,680
metaphors to activate what people already know.

155
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,320
And thirdly, of course, if you don't just use a single image and overload that one,

156
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,080
but start a sequence that your colleagues can build upon.

157
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,680
Thank you very much.
