[00:00.000 --> 00:08.800]  How can we use the power of pictures at work?
[00:08.800 --> 00:14.800]  How can you visualize what you think, what you know, and make that accessible for others
[00:14.800 --> 00:17.120]  to improve collaboration?
[00:17.120 --> 00:22.960]  I have been obsessed with this question for 30 years, in 20 books, in 200 articles, in
[00:22.960 --> 00:25.980]  more than dozens of experiments.
[00:25.980 --> 00:31.740]  And what I found are amazing benefits that happen when you draw, when you use visualization
[00:31.740 --> 00:34.100]  software, when you sketch, when you doodle.
[00:34.100 --> 00:40.740]  You boost your creativity, you improve collaboration and communication of better conflicts, and
[00:40.740 --> 00:46.940]  you also improve your decision quality when you visualize the information that you have.
[00:46.940 --> 00:52.460]  But what I also found was that many of us don't use the potential of visualization at
[00:52.460 --> 00:53.780]  all.
[00:53.780 --> 00:57.900]  We stick to old ways of presenting, of discussing.
[00:57.900 --> 00:59.900]  Can I ask you this?
[00:59.900 --> 01:05.100]  Who among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?
[01:05.100 --> 01:06.820]  Who loves to sit through that?
[01:06.820 --> 01:10.740]  Okay, we have four people.
[01:10.740 --> 01:12.580]  For the rest, can you give me alternatives?
[01:12.580 --> 01:15.460]  What can you do instead of bombarding people with slides?
[01:15.460 --> 01:18.660]  What would be a visual way of working?
[01:18.660 --> 01:20.940]  Storytelling, what else?
[01:20.940 --> 01:21.940]  Prezi.
[01:21.940 --> 01:22.940]  Yes.
[01:23.100 --> 01:25.020]  Sketching, what else?
[01:25.020 --> 01:27.460]  Mind mapping.
[01:27.460 --> 01:28.460]  Whiteboard, right?
[01:28.460 --> 01:29.660]  There are many ways.
[01:29.660 --> 01:34.580]  When you invite people to visualize with you, to co-create what you're actually doing, and
[01:34.580 --> 01:40.780]  this is the first of many visual metaphors to come, you're sort of laying out a mini
[01:40.780 --> 01:45.740]  red carpet to invite them to shine.
[01:45.740 --> 01:53.140]  It's also a red thread that the conversation has when you invite others to visualize with
[01:53.140 --> 01:54.140]  you.
[01:54.140 --> 01:57.820]  So what I'd like to share in the next five to six minutes with you are three practices
[01:57.820 --> 02:04.200]  that help you to invite others to visualize together.
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.700]  But first, can I take you back just a minute to my very first high-stake presentation,
[02:08.700 --> 02:14.980]  not as a university professor, but in my former life as a consultant.
[02:15.020 --> 02:19.460]  A client had asked us to analyze if they should enter a new multi-billion market, and we worked
[02:19.460 --> 02:25.700]  very hard to analyze this market, and I had produced about 40 data-driven slides to show
[02:25.700 --> 02:30.940]  the client that we had worked hard and that he should not enter this business.
[02:30.940 --> 02:36.740]  Just as I was ready to go and bombard the client with those slides, my then boss said,
[02:36.740 --> 02:38.980]  Martin, take a seat.
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.900]  Hold your horses.
[02:40.900 --> 02:47.500]  And instead of me going through the slides, he showed the perplexed audience one sketch,
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.340]  one visual metaphor, and it was this one.
[02:50.340 --> 02:54.340]  It was a fortress built on sand.
[02:54.340 --> 02:59.840]  This guy had just summarized all of my 40 slides in a single image because he was right.
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.340]  This new market was like a fortress, very hard to conquer because of patent shields,
[03:05.340 --> 03:09.080]  economies of scale contracts, and it was not even worth conquering.
[03:09.080 --> 03:13.680]  It was sinking into the sand, so to speak, because the technology was being replaced
[03:13.680 --> 03:15.520]  by another one.
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.320]  And of course, the client then asked about details like the patent analysis I had done
[03:19.320 --> 03:24.760]  or the contracts and so forth, and I could show finally my slide with that analysis.
[03:24.760 --> 03:30.680]  But this leading with a visual metaphor really changed the dynamics of the conversation.
[03:30.680 --> 03:32.480]  It was much more collaborative.
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.680]  First the overview with this visual metaphor, and then the details on demand.
[03:37.680 --> 03:40.120]  And I realized it's all about a conversation.
[03:40.120 --> 03:44.240]  It's much better this way when you first show overview with the help of a metaphor that,
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.360]  by the way, the client picked up and used also verbally.
[03:48.360 --> 03:50.840]  And that got me thinking as a researcher.
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.400]  And in many experiments with managers and students, we found three practices that I
[03:55.400 --> 04:02.440]  want to share with you that you can use to really reap the power of pictures professionally.
[04:02.440 --> 04:06.280]  And the first one might shock you.
[04:06.280 --> 04:11.040]  Especially the design aficionados among you.
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.320]  If you want visualization, graphic representations to work for you and for collaboration, make
[04:17.320 --> 04:20.800]  them ugly.
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.640]  Beauty is the enemy of collaboration.
[04:22.640 --> 04:27.240]  If something looks too nice, it looks like it doesn't need revision or improvement.
[04:27.240 --> 04:29.560]  I call this the museum effect.
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.380]  People just stare and say, yeah, that looks perfect, and the thinking stops there.
[04:34.380 --> 04:37.800]  So you want to use the power of provisionality.
[04:37.800 --> 04:42.860]  You want to signal with your drawings, this is work in progress, and invite collaboration
[04:42.860 --> 04:43.860]  in this way.
[04:43.860 --> 04:47.300]  So this is good news for all of us who are terrible at drawing.
[04:47.300 --> 04:48.540]  So it's not a bug.
[04:48.540 --> 04:49.860]  It's a feature.
[04:49.860 --> 04:54.840]  The technical term is low perceived finishness.
[04:54.840 --> 04:56.280]  It looks provisional.
[04:56.280 --> 04:58.620]  It invites collaboration.
[04:58.620 --> 05:04.080]  And by the way, banks and telecom companies and insurances have been using this all along.
[05:04.080 --> 05:06.360]  It's called pencil selling.
[05:06.360 --> 05:11.200]  When instead of using shiny slides, you just sketch something with a pencil for a client,
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.200]  like a product.
[05:12.200 --> 05:15.840]  In our experiments, we were able to show this actually is much better.
[05:15.840 --> 05:17.320]  It leads to more sales.
[05:17.320 --> 05:23.320]  So if you want to harness the power of visualization for collaboration, make them look ugly.
[05:23.320 --> 05:24.420]  Make them look provisional.
[05:24.420 --> 05:26.040]  Use sketches and doodles.
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.640]  And we've shown in our experiments even little tweaks to software to make it look more sketchy,
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.200]  boosts collaboration and creativity.
[05:35.200 --> 05:39.880]  And this brings me to the second advice I'd like to share with you.
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.800]  Like my boss, lead with visual metaphors.
[05:43.800 --> 05:49.040]  Don't just use diagrams, although they are powerful, or charts or maps.
[05:49.040 --> 05:51.520]  Visual metaphors are magical.
[05:51.520 --> 05:54.380]  They access what people already know.
[05:54.380 --> 05:57.560]  They bring out new solution ideas.
[05:57.560 --> 06:02.840]  They make things much more concrete, like a mini red carpet or a red thread.
[06:02.840 --> 06:04.260]  Let me give you an example.
[06:04.260 --> 06:08.840]  In a study that we originally did for BMW financial services and then published, we
[06:08.840 --> 06:17.640]  used the identical strategy of BMW and communicated it to different staff members, groups.
[06:17.640 --> 06:22.320]  Once we used standard bullet point slides, then we used a diagram.
[06:22.320 --> 06:28.000]  And for the third group, we used the mountain trail visual metaphor with the same content
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.040]  as the other two.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.700]  And guess what?
[06:30.700 --> 06:35.520]  For the group where we visualized through the mountain trail the strategy, not only
[06:35.520 --> 06:41.840]  did they remember a lot more later on, they were also much more motivated to implement
[06:41.840 --> 06:44.120]  the strategy.
[06:44.120 --> 06:50.040]  Now I've never met a four I didn't like, but clearly not all metaphors are equally well
[06:50.040 --> 06:51.040]  suited.
[06:51.080 --> 06:55.200]  So you have to make sure that the metaphor is simpler than what you're trying to explain,
[06:55.200 --> 06:57.960]  that it's concrete and that people have a connection with it.
[06:57.960 --> 06:59.640]  And that is hopefully the right connection.
[06:59.640 --> 07:04.800]  I will never use again the volcano metaphor as I did once for creativity in a country
[07:04.800 --> 07:07.840]  that is at risk of active volcanoes.
[07:07.840 --> 07:10.320]  So choose your metaphors well.
[07:10.320 --> 07:13.640]  And if you do that, then it will resonate with people.
[07:13.640 --> 07:15.440]  It will be much more memorable.
[07:15.440 --> 07:18.680]  It sticks like a red ribbon on the floor.
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.480]  Here's another example of such a visual metaphor.
[07:22.480 --> 07:23.480]  It can come from nature.
[07:23.480 --> 07:24.480]  It can come from technology.
[07:24.480 --> 07:26.640]  It can come from mythology.
[07:26.640 --> 07:27.640]  You name it.
[07:27.640 --> 07:30.560]  Here I used the bridge to visualize a few.
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.780]  I'm a professor of communications management, a few communication problems.
[07:35.780 --> 07:38.500]  And so it's simple, also visually.
[07:38.500 --> 07:46.120]  And the beauty of this kind of visual, we can learn that from comic strips, is that
[07:46.240 --> 07:49.400]  it starts a series that people then want to complete.
[07:49.400 --> 07:51.880]  And I think that's very powerful in collaboration.
[07:51.880 --> 07:56.120]  I call this third practice that I want to share with you in conclusion.
[07:56.120 --> 07:59.280]  I call this visual variation.
[07:59.280 --> 08:02.760]  You use a metaphor or a diagram and then you vary it.
[08:02.760 --> 08:05.420]  You repeat it, but slightly differently.
[08:05.420 --> 08:09.560]  And the magic that this does for collaboration is people start to extend the series you're
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.560]  giving them.
[08:10.560 --> 08:15.820]  So for example, here communication is one-sided because of a lack of listening, right?
[08:15.820 --> 08:21.700]  One-way street or the bridge is not aligned, there's misunderstandings or it's too full,
[08:21.700 --> 08:24.540]  the too many messages crowd out, the key message.
[08:24.540 --> 08:28.780]  And people automatically think of other communication problems through the metaphor of the bridge.
[08:28.780 --> 08:34.100]  Like one car going off the bridge maybe because the person is too emotional, right?
[08:34.100 --> 08:38.740]  Or the bridge being shaky maybe because there's no trust in the relationship.
[08:38.740 --> 08:47.660]  Two metaphors spark the imagination, especially if they come in a series of images.
[08:47.660 --> 08:51.900]  This is by the way a very empirically validated theory.
[08:51.900 --> 08:59.020]  It's called variation theory and it basically says that you do not understand anything until
[08:59.020 --> 09:01.880]  you understand it in more than one way.
[09:01.880 --> 09:07.140]  And so if you ask me for advice how to make visuals more part of your everyday work, I
[09:07.580 --> 09:12.900]  start a series, start a simple image, it doesn't have to be sophisticated and invite others
[09:12.900 --> 09:15.060]  to build on that.
[09:15.060 --> 09:18.020]  Here is my final example for that.
[09:18.020 --> 09:24.260]  As university professor we often advise students and many of our students still have this stereotypical
[09:24.260 --> 09:29.580]  career path in mind that it only goes upward in terms of salary or hierarchy and I drew
[09:29.580 --> 09:34.580]  this visual variation to invite them to think about alternative career trajectories so the
[09:34.580 --> 09:36.420]  career doesn't have to be linear.
[09:36.420 --> 09:44.940]  In fact, I find, I don't know about you, that the most intriguing careers are often non-linear,
[09:44.940 --> 09:50.020]  are different than this upward staircase model.
[09:50.020 --> 09:55.940]  So in conclusion, go forth and visualize or vanish, use the power of pictures and when
[09:55.940 --> 10:02.120]  you do that you will see it boosts your creativity, it improves decisions, especially if you use
[10:02.280 --> 10:07.120]  images that signal that they are working in progress, that invite others like a carpet,
[10:07.120 --> 10:13.640]  a red carpet to shine together, to co-create something new together.
[10:13.640 --> 10:19.320]  Especially if you don't just rely on abstract diagrams or charts but use the power of visual
[10:19.320 --> 10:22.640]  metaphors to activate what people already know.
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.800]  And thirdly of course, if you don't just use a single image and overload that one but start
[10:27.800 --> 10:31.040]  a sequence that your colleagues can build upon.
[10:31.040 --> 10:31.640]  Thank you very much.
