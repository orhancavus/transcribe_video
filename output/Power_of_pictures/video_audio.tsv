0	8800	How can we use the power of pictures at work?
8800	14800	How can you visualize what you think, what you know, and make that accessible for others
14800	17120	to improve collaboration?
17120	22960	I have been obsessed with this question for 30 years, in 20 books, in 200 articles, in
22960	25980	more than dozens of experiments.
25980	31740	And what I found are amazing benefits that happen when you draw, when you use visualization
31740	34100	software, when you sketch, when you doodle.
34100	40740	You boost your creativity, you improve collaboration and communication of better conflicts, and
40740	46940	you also improve your decision quality when you visualize the information that you have.
46940	52460	But what I also found was that many of us don't use the potential of visualization at
52460	53780	all.
53780	57900	We stick to old ways of presenting, of discussing.
57900	59900	Can I ask you this?
59900	65100	Who among you still loves standard presentation slides with bullet points?
65100	66820	Who loves to sit through that?
66820	70740	Okay, we have four people.
70740	72580	For the rest, can you give me alternatives?
72580	75460	What can you do instead of bombarding people with slides?
75460	78660	What would be a visual way of working?
78660	80900	Storytelling, what else?
80900	81900	Prezi.
81900	82900	Prezi.
83020	84340	Just sketching.
84340	85340	What else?
85340	86340	Mind mapping.
86340	87340	Whiteboard.
87340	88340	Right?
88340	93700	There are many ways when you invite people to visualize with you, to co-create what you're
93700	97820	actually doing, and this is the first of many visual metaphors to come, you're sort of laying
97820	105800	out a mini red carpet to invite them to shine.
105800	113200	It's also a red thread that the conversation has when you invite others to visualize with
113200	114200	you.
114200	117880	So what I'd like to share in the next five to six minutes with you are three practices
117880	124280	that help you to invite others to visualize together.
124280	128760	But first, can I take you back just a minute to my very first high-stake presentation,
128760	135040	not as a university professor, but in my former life as a consultant.
135040	139200	My client had asked us to analyze if they should enter a new multi-billion market, and
139200	144720	we worked very hard to analyze this market, and I had produced about 40 data-driven slides
144720	150960	to show the client that we had worked hard and that he should not enter this business.
150960	156800	Just as I was ready to go and bombard the client with those slides, my then boss said,
156800	159000	Martin, take a seat.
159000	160920	Hold your horses.
160920	167520	And instead of me going through the slides, he showed the perplexed audience one sketch,
167520	170360	one visual metaphor, and it was this one.
170360	174380	It was a fortress built on sand.
174380	179880	This guy had just summarized all of my 40 slides in a single image because he was right.
179880	185360	This new market was like a fortress, very hard to conquer because of patent shields,
185360	189120	economies of scale contracts, and it was not even worth conquering.
189120	193680	It was sinking into the sand, so to speak, because the technology was being replaced
193680	195520	by another one.
195520	199320	And of course, the client then asked about details like the patent analysis I had done
199320	204400	or the contracts and so forth, and I could show finally my slide with that analysis.
204400	210680	But this leading with a visual metaphor really changed the dynamics of the conversation.
210680	212480	It was much more collaborative.
212480	217680	First the overview with this visual metaphor, and then the details on demand.
217680	220120	And I realized it's all about a conversation.
220120	224200	It's much better this way when you first show overview with the help of a metaphor that,
224200	228360	by the way, the client picked up and used also verbally.
228360	230840	And that got me thinking as a researcher.
230840	235400	And in many experiments with managers and students, we found three practices that I
235400	242440	want to share with you that you can use to really reap the power of pictures professionally.
242440	246280	And the first one might shock you.
246280	251040	Especially the design aficionados among you.
251040	257320	If you want visualization, graphic representations to work for you and for collaboration, make
257320	260800	them ugly.
260800	262640	Beauty is the enemy of collaboration.
262640	267240	If something looks too nice, it looks like it doesn't need revision or improvement.
267240	269560	I call this the museum effect.
269560	274380	People just stare and say, yeah, that looks perfect, and the thinking stops there.
274380	277800	So you want to use the power of provisionality.
277800	282860	You want to signal with your drawings, this is work in progress, and invite collaboration
282860	283860	in this way.
283860	287280	So this is good news for all of us who are terrible at drawing.
287280	289840	So it's not a bug, it's a feature.
289840	294840	The technical term is low perceived finishness.
294840	296280	It looks provisional.
296280	298620	It invites collaboration.
298620	304080	And by the way, banks and telecom companies and insurances have been using this all along.
304080	309160	It's called pencil selling, when instead of using shiny slides, you just sketch something
309160	312560	with a pencil for a client, like a product.
312560	317320	In our experiments, we were able to show this actually is much better, leads to more sales.
317320	323320	So if you want to harness the power of visualization for collaboration, make them look ugly.
323320	324420	Make them look provisional.
324420	326040	Use sketches and doodles.
326040	331640	And we've shown in our experiments even little tweaks to software to make it look more sketchy,
331640	335200	boosts collaboration and creativity.
335200	339880	And this brings me to the second advice I'd like to share with you.
339880	343780	Like my boss, lead with visual metaphors.
343780	349040	Don't just use diagrams, although they are powerful, or charts or maps.
349040	351520	Visual metaphors are magical.
351520	354380	They access what people already know.
354380	357560	They bring out new solution ideas.
357560	362840	They make things much more concrete, like a mini red carpet or a red thread.
362840	364260	Let me give you an example.
364260	368840	In a study that we originally did for BMW financial services and then published, we
368840	377640	used the identical strategy of BMW and communicated it to different staff members, groups.
377640	382320	Once we used standard bullet point slides, then we used a diagram.
382320	388000	And for the third group, we used the mountain trail visual metaphor with the same content
388000	389040	as the other two.
389040	390700	And guess what?
390700	395520	For the group where we visualized through the mountain trail the strategy, not only
395520	401800	did they remember a lot more later on, they were also much more motivated to implement
401800	404120	the strategy.
404120	409600	Now I've never met a four I didn't like, but clearly not all metaphors are equally
409600	410700	well suited.
410700	415180	You want to make sure that the metaphor is simpler than what you're trying to explain,
415180	418780	that it's concrete and that people have a connection with it, and that is hopefully
418780	419780	the right connection.
419780	424780	I will never use again the volcano metaphor as I did once for creativity in a country
424780	427820	that is at risk of active volcanoes.
427820	433640	So choose your metaphors well, and if you do that, then it will resonate with people.
433640	435440	It will be much more memorable.
435440	438660	It sticks like a red ribbon on the floor.
438660	442460	Here's another example of such a visual metaphor.
442460	446620	It can come from nature, it can come from technology, it can come from mythology, you
446620	447620	name it.
447620	452620	Here I used the bridge to visualize a few, I'm a professor of communications management,
452620	455780	a few communication problems.
455780	458500	And so it's simple, also visually.
458500	466100	And the beauty of this kind of visual, we can learn that from comic strips, is that
466260	471020	it starts a series that people then want to complete, and I think that's very powerful
471020	472020	in collaboration.
472020	476920	I call this third practice that I want to share with you in conclusion, I call this
476920	479320	visual variation.
479320	482800	You use a metaphor or a diagram, and then you vary it.
482800	485460	You repeat it, but slightly differently.
485460	489620	And the magic that this does for collaboration is people start to extend the series you're
489620	490620	giving them.
490620	495860	So for example here, communication is one-sided because of a lack of listening, right?
495860	501700	One-way street, or the bridge is not aligned, there's misunderstandings, or it's too full,
501700	504580	the too many messages crowd out, the key message.
504580	508820	And people automatically think of other communication problems through the metaphor of the bridge.
508820	514120	Like one car going off the bridge, maybe because the person is too emotional, right?
514120	518760	Or the bridge being shaky, maybe because there's no trust in the relationship.
518760	527640	Two metaphors spark the imagination, especially if they come in a series of images.
527640	534600	This is, by the way, a very empirically validated theory, it's called variation theory, and
534600	540280	it basically says that you do not understand anything until you understand it in more than
540280	541880	one way.
541880	547120	And so if you ask me for advice how to make visuals more part of your everyday work, I
547600	551880	would say start a series, start a simple image, it doesn't have to be sophisticated, and invite
551880	555080	others to build on that.
555080	558040	Here is my final example for that.
558040	564280	As university professor we often advise students, and many of our students still have this stereotypical
564280	569600	career path in mind that it only goes upward in terms of salary or hierarchy, and I drew
569600	574520	this visual variation to invite them to think about alternative career trajectories, so
574520	576440	the career doesn't have to be linear.
576440	583200	In fact, I find, I don't know how about you, that the most intriguing careers are often
583200	590040	non-linear, are different than this upward staircase model.
590040	595960	So in conclusion, go forth and visualize or vanish, use the power of pictures, and when
595960	602160	you do that you will see it boosts your creativity, it improves decisions, especially if you use
602160	606880	images that signal that they are work in progress, that invite others, like a carpet
606880	613680	to, a red carpet to shine together, to co-create something new together.
613680	619360	Especially if you don't just rely on abstract diagrams or charts, but use the power of visual
619360	622680	metaphors to activate what people already know.
622680	627320	And thirdly, of course, if you don't just use a single image and overload that one,
627320	631080	but start a sequence that your colleagues can build upon.
631080	631680	Thank you very much.
