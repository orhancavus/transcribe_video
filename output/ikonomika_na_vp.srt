1
0:00:00,000000 --> 0:00:00,990000
759 pages about the perverted political fantasies and violence,

2
0:00:06,000000 --> 0:00:06,990000
about the powerlessness, fear and suffering, about the economic shocks.

3
0:00:10,000000 --> 0:00:10,990000
This is not a psycho-thriller advertisement.

4
0:00:13,000000 --> 0:00:13,990000
This is the third study by the triptych by Rumen Avramov.

5
0:00:17,000000 --> 0:00:17,990000
We have a diamond of academic work,

6
0:00:20,000000 --> 0:00:20,990000
a study of the dissection of state policies towards the Turks and Muslims in Bulgaria,

7
0:00:25,000000 --> 0:00:25,990000
at a very high price for all.

8
0:00:28,000000 --> 0:00:28,990000
The headline and the proposed content are somewhat misleading.

9
0:00:33,000000 --> 0:00:33,990000
They suggest a study and analysis only of the reviving process

10
0:00:37,000000 --> 0:00:37,990000
and its economic dimensions in 1984-1989.

11
0:00:42,000000 --> 0:00:42,990000
In fact, Avramov's investigative methodology methodology and technocratic approach would not have allowed such a thing.

12
0:00:50,000000 --> 0:00:50,990000
The scholar Avramov is so precise and uncompromising in his academic intentions that he made detailed

13
0:00:57,000000 --> 0:00:57,990000
retrospectives to follow Bulgaria's policy of liberation of the Turkish and Muslim communities as a whole.

14
0:01:06,000000 --> 0:01:06,990000
The book's contribution is multifaceted and complex.

15
0:01:10,000000 --> 0:01:10,990000
I will give only a few basic contributions.

16
0:01:14,000000 --> 0:01:14,990000
The first contribution.

17
0:01:17,000000 --> 0:01:17,990000
From an academic point of view, this is the most valuable collection and interpretation of archives and data, structured precisely, commented mercilessly, which we have had until now.

18
0:01:30,000000 --> 0:01:30,990000
In the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, when we were writing declarations

19
0:01:35,000000 --> 0:01:35,990000
and enlightening political texts on the revolutionary process

20
0:01:39,000000 --> 0:01:39,990000
and in the defense of the Turks and the Muslims, we introduced certain clichés

21
0:01:44,000000 --> 0:01:44,990000
of the type of adventurous politics, we introduced certain clichés of an adventurous policy,

22
0:01:47,000000 --> 0:01:47,990000
criminal ideas and actions, but we especially emphasized the non-contradictory policy of

23
0:01:53,000000 --> 0:01:53,990000
the state towards the minorities. Rumen arranged everything with his characteristic perfectionism

24
0:01:59,000000 --> 0:01:59,990000
and it turned out that there is no more consistent state policy in Bulgaria than the one aimed at or rather against the minority.

25
0:02:09,000000 --> 0:02:09,990000
A devastating administrative responsibility, regardless of the years, the government, the regimes, the form of government.

26
0:02:17,000000 --> 0:02:17,990000
What we have perceived as an indiscretion is actually a systematic approval of new and new variants of assimilation,

27
0:02:26,000000 --> 0:02:26,990000
treatment of memory, destruction of culture, maintenance of social equality.

28
0:02:32,000000 --> 0:02:32,990000
And when all the attempts are failed, the final solution is achieved,

29
0:02:37,000000 --> 0:02:37,990000
which in the case of the Turks and the Pamacians is displacement, displacement,

30
0:02:41,000000 --> 0:02:41,990000
marauding, damages of all kinds.

31
0:02:45,000000 --> 0:02:45,990000
The reader remains with the feeling that different regimes have competed which is better in the assimilation experience.

32
0:02:53,000000 --> 0:02:53,990000
Example from page 31.

33
0:02:55,000000 --> 0:02:55,990000
Report of the police from October 1934.

34
0:03:00,000000 --> 0:03:00,990000
Admit, quotes, we can not make the illusion that we will someday bury the Turks alive in the country and turn them into Bulgarians.

35
0:03:09,000000 --> 0:03:09,990000
According to Avramov, the strategic conclusion is that we should do everything possible for the Turks to become impoverished,

36
0:03:18,000000 --> 0:03:18,990000
for the cultural and moral level to be as low as possible, and for the material and economic relations they are not allowed to step on their feet.

37
0:03:28,000000 --> 0:03:28,990000
This is the case in the 1930s.

38
0:03:31,000000 --> 0:03:31,990000
Therefore, as seen in the tables at the end of the book,

39
0:03:35,000000 --> 0:03:35,990000
in the period from 1934 to 1943,

40
0:03:39,000000 --> 0:03:39,990000
about 62,000 people were displaced.

41
0:03:42,000000 --> 0:03:42,990000
I go back in time even further.

42
0:03:45,000000 --> 0:03:45,990000
In the 1920s, the option for final solution of the issue was adopted

43
0:03:50,000000 --> 0:03:50,990000
through the principle of free migration, which led to the migration

44
0:03:57,000000 --> 0:03:57,990000
between 1924 and 1934 of 166,485 of our fellow citizens.

45
0:04:05,000000 --> 0:04:05,990000
Not a few of them were victims of speculators from both sides of the border

46
0:04:10,000000 --> 0:04:10,990000
and remained without anything to start from scratch here or there.

47
0:04:16,000000 --> 0:04:16,990000
I have recorded several interviews with respondents who were children

48
0:04:20,000000 --> 0:04:20,990000
during these attempts to settle in the late 20th century and keep their memory

49
0:04:25,000000 --> 0:04:25,990000
for the robbery. 50 years after the realistic report of Mevera from 1934, self-confident

50
0:04:34,000000 --> 0:04:34,990000
and convinced in the unconditional Stalinist experience, the managers of the Politburo

51
0:04:40,000000 --> 0:04:40,990000
and the Central Committee undertake the grandiose event of the detachment of the Turkish and Muslim countries as part of the Bulgarian nation through the exchange of their ethnicity,

52
0:04:47,000000 --> 0:04:47,990000
identity and religion and through persecution.

53
0:04:51,000000 --> 0:04:51,990000
The second contribution is to the historiography of the countries from Southeast Europe.

54
0:04:57,000000 --> 0:04:57,990000
All Balkan countries have tried variants of terror,

55
0:05:06,000000 --> 0:05:06,990000
assimilation and deportation,

56
0:05:08,000000 --> 0:05:08,990000
and even direct extermination of their different minorities.

57
0:05:12,000000 --> 0:05:12,990000
Turkey, Greece, Serbia, Croatia,

58
0:05:14,000000 --> 0:05:14,990000
let me not mention all the Balkan countries.

59
0:05:16,000000 --> 0:05:16,990000
Thanks to the research of Rumen Avramov,

60
0:05:20,000000 --> 0:05:20,990000
Bulgarian historiography has become the first and only one for now, which has collected,

61
0:05:26,560000 --> 0:05:32,680000
edited and commented objectively on its own Bulgarian perfidious experience in assimilation

62
0:05:32,680000 --> 0:05:38,460000
policies, in the eviction, the persecution, the reduction of large human masses from the

63
0:05:38,460000 --> 0:05:39,800000
youth community.

64
0:05:40,520000 --> 0:05:48
Look at the stressing tables 8 and 9, where the internal deportations as a plan

65
0:05:48,000000 --> 0:05:48,990000
for five years are called cynically-voluntarily disengaged by the Bulgarian Turks and during

66
0:05:55,000000 --> 0:05:55,990000
the period 1986-1990 45,300 people were predicted, and until 2000, the next five years, 180,000 people were predicted.

67
0:06:07,000000 --> 0:06:07,990000
The displaced people in February 1986 were described as sending and receiving refugees.

68
0:06:17,000000 --> 0:06:17,990000
There is a plan and fulfillment when it is the word for people and families who have been raised and deported from their homes and villages

69
0:06:26,760000 --> 0:06:29,760000
and interned in other parts of the country.

70
0:06:29,760000 --> 0:06:32,760000
The third benefit is the civil one.

71
0:06:32,760000 --> 0:06:36,760000
Rumen Avramov insists on his image of a technocrat.

72
0:06:36,760000 --> 0:06:38,760000
He is like that and we value him.

73
0:06:38,760000 --> 0:06:45
But under his dark technocratic head, a brave citizen's heart is beating in his book is a bold citizen's heart.

74
0:06:45,000000 --> 0:06:45,990000
An absolute intolerance to evil, which people can cause to other people.

75
0:06:51,000000 --> 0:06:51,990000
He calls the last two chapters of his book the first deviation and the second deviation,

76
0:06:57,000000 --> 0:06:57,990000
as an apology somehow, as if he had read it, because there are no numbers, percentages and tables, but purely human and civil contempt

77
0:07:06,000000 --> 0:07:06,990000
from the attempts to protect the memory of 10-12% of the population of Bulgaria and to turn into

78
0:07:13,000000 --> 0:07:13,990000
transverse and indirect partners the remaining 90%.

79
0:07:17,000000 --> 0:07:17,990000
They make skeptics to completely pessimistic forecasts for the future, connected with

80
0:07:23,000000 --> 0:07:23,990000
destabilization of modern politics on a global scale and the

81
0:07:27,000000 --> 0:07:27,990000
fall of the political system and the moral and national level. In fact, he was trying

82
0:07:34,000000 --> 0:07:34,990000
to isolate himself as a humane person in both deviations, because on every page of his

83
0:07:40,000000 --> 0:07:40,990000
book, among the numbers, percentages, documents and decisions, the archive units, his books, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

84
0:07:45,000000 --> 0:07:45,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

85
0:07:46,000000 --> 0:07:46,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

86
0:07:47,000000 --> 0:07:47,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

87
0:07:48,000000 --> 0:07:48,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

88
0:07:49,000000 --> 0:07:49,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

89
0:07:50,000000 --> 0:07:50,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

90
0:07:51,000000 --> 0:07:51,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

91
0:07:52,000000 --> 0:07:52,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

92
0:07:53,000000 --> 0:07:53,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

93
0:07:54,000000 --> 0:07:54,990000

97
0:07:58,000000 --> 0:07:58,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

98
0:07:59,000000 --> 0:07:59,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

99
0:08:00,000000 --> 0:08:00,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

100
0:08:01,000000 --> 0:08:01,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his

101
0:08:02,000000 --> 0:08:02,990000
articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his articles, his This is a very comprehensive and full-fledged apology to our fellow citizens of Turkey and the West,

102
0:08:07,000000 --> 0:08:07,990000
which was never made by the politicians, except for a few sincere and pitiful parliamentary speeches,

103
0:08:14,000000 --> 0:08:14,990000
convincing declarations and a tasteless kiss on the cheek.

104
0:08:18,000000 --> 0:08:18,990000
The fourth contribution is somewhat related to the previous three and I call it morally right.

105
0:08:26,000000 --> 0:08:26,990000
Because with the great artistic effort and talent of Rumen Abramov we have gathered,

106
0:08:31,000000 --> 0:08:31,990000
sorted and analyzed the main politics of the Bulgarian state institutions and the party elites towards the youth.

107
0:08:40,000000 --> 0:08:40,990000
This book sounds like a plenary against the ruling class, regardless of the regime of the government.

108
0:08:47,000000 --> 0:08:47,990000
It does not erase the concrete names of the people who have conceived and implemented the culprits for the huge economic and political damages committed by the entire Bulgarian nation and the Bulgarian state.

109
0:09:25,000000 --> 0:09:25,990000
to investigate the Prosecutor's Office and the court, nor the politicians, was done by the scientist Avramov, with whom he protected the academic community,

110
0:09:30,000000 --> 0:09:30,990000
because he reminded that we are not completely safe.

111
0:09:35,000000 --> 0:09:35,990000
Rume is not a pessimist. I am an optimist in this case.

112
0:09:41,000000 --> 0:09:41,990000
What inspires optimism and satisfaction for the thing is that the authors' voices and comments are the reason for the great failure, panic and fear among the authors,

113
0:09:56,000000 --> 0:09:56,990000
that they have caught something dangerous and absurd, from which there is no easy escape. They failed in nothing but their perverse fantasies and social engineering.

114
0:10:07,000000 --> 0:10:07,990000
They didn't identify, they didn't strengthen, they didn't erase their writing and oral memory, they made it stronger.

115
0:10:14,000000 --> 0:10:14,990000
They didn't bring to nothing the 10% of the population, they made it economically more flexible and stable.

116
0:10:22,000000 --> 0:10:22,990000
But the most important thing is that they didn't bring us to intolerance in order to shed their blood.

117
0:10:28,000000 --> 0:10:28,990000
The conversations with the persecuted respondents in Turkey ended years in a row with various variations of pity and compassion.

118
0:10:39,000000 --> 0:10:39,990000
We stepped on our feet, but how will you manage to make it happen sooner?

119
0:10:45,000000 --> 0:10:45,990000
In fact, the great people in this dark history are our fellow citizens, the Turks, who did not hesitate at all.

120
0:10:53,000000 --> 0:10:53,990000
They felt and helped us to feel the same compassion as the common children in a violent family.

121
0:11:01,000000 --> 0:11:01,990000
The persecuted rebuild their lives again, but what will be the fate of the rest of the people?

122
0:11:07,000000 --> 0:11:07,990000
Only in short historical segments of time have we had peace, because now again we are worried about the fate of our persecuted people,

123
0:11:17,000000 --> 0:11:17,990000
when in Turkey there is an authoritarian government with an unclear future. We have lived it more than once. The ethnic politics of the communist regime and especially its most brutal form,

124
0:11:29,000000 --> 0:11:29,990000
which has been given a certain absurd name – the revolutionary process,

125
0:11:33,000000 --> 0:11:33,990000
have been devoted to a series of historiographical research and documentary collections.

126
0:11:38,000000 --> 0:11:38,990000
Without being exhaustive and limiting ourselves only to the contribution of Bulgarian science,

127
0:11:42,000000 --> 0:11:42,990000
I will mention in chronological order the research of Valery Stoyanov, Ibrahim Yalomov, Evgeny Ivanova, Alexey Kalyonsky and Mikhail Groev,

128
0:11:50,000000 --> 0:11:50,990000
as well as the documentary collections of Veselin Angelov and Iskra Baeva and Evgenia Kalinova.

129
0:11:55,000000 --> 0:11:55,990000
In this list, these days, the significant research of Rumen Avramov and the economics of the development process took place.

130
0:12:03,000000 --> 0:12:03,990000
The research of Rumen is different in its specifics. Those who have

131
0:12:07,000000 --> 0:12:07,990000
studied the problems of ethnic relations know that this is a matter that is influenced by

132
0:12:13,000000 --> 0:12:13,990000
various factors, the key between these factors is economic. On the other hand, economic

133
0:12:19,000000 --> 0:12:19,990000
relations also depend on a number of changes, one of which is the ethnic one. We know the history that the onset of the ethnic crisis and the economic crisis

134
0:12:29,000000 --> 0:12:29,990000
leads to a resonance, a mixture of explosive danger, which can cause powerful destructive processes.

135
0:12:36,000000 --> 0:12:36,990000
In this context, we have so far only with the study of ethnic relations in the period of the economic crisis, which was brought to the time directly after the change of 1989,

136
0:12:49,000000 --> 0:12:49,990000
which was established by a team of economists led by Jordan Christoskov and sociologist Antoni Gull.

137
0:12:55,000000 --> 0:12:55,990000
The book The Economics of the Development Process is a large-scale and extensive study

138
0:13:01,000000 --> 0:13:01,990000
of the connection between economics and ethnic politics, when both,

139
0:13:07,000000 --> 0:13:07,990000
by the force of their autonomous development, reach a crisis.

140
0:13:11,000000 --> 0:13:11,990000
We have a crisis in the economic and the economic relations in 1989.

141
0:13:19,000000 --> 0:13:19,990000
And the consequences of the creation of these two crises.

142
0:13:23,000000 --> 0:13:23,990000
Here I will allow myself to make a comment.

143
0:13:26,000000 --> 0:13:26,990000
There is still no unity in the maintenance of the term

144
0:13:29,000000 --> 0:13:29,990000
of the revolutionary process.

145
0:13:31,000000 --> 0:13:31,990000
Some of those who are with me on this issue

146
0:13:34,000000 --> 0:13:34,990000
understand the total violence and simulation

147
0:13:37,000000 --> 0:13:37,990000
of the communist regime in relation to the Muslims in Bulgaria.

148
0:13:41,000000 --> 0:13:41,990000
It was carried out in a full, uncompromising

149
0:13:44,000000 --> 0:13:44,990000
and especially active period between 1969 and 1989. of the Bulgarian Muslims, carried out in a planned, uncompromising and

150
0:13:45,220000 --> 0:13:51,400000
actively judged period between 1969 and 1989. The basis for this understanding is that

151
0:13:51,420000 --> 0:13:56,320000
violent assimilation is not only linked to the violence of changing names and

152
0:13:56,340000 --> 0:14:01,100000
the identification of these names in all areas of life, which is shown perfectly in the book.

153
0:14:07,000000 --> 0:14:07,990000
in the book, the head of the pamphlet. The foundation is as follows. The assimilation, the capital of violence, the change of identity includes repression

154
0:14:12,000000 --> 0:14:12,990000
against foreign religions, languages and cultures and their rejection both of the life

155
0:14:18,000000 --> 0:14:18,990000
of a separate person and of the national spiritual life, culture and education.

156
0:14:22,000000 --> 0:14:22,990000
We know that from 1969 to 1984 the Bulgarian Turks were deprived of their right to a self-sufficient cultural and spiritual life in all their professions,

157
0:14:31,000000 --> 0:14:31,990000
and only the names remained in the daily order of the regime's simulation policy.

158
0:14:36,000000 --> 0:14:36,990000
Along with this, dramatic episodes of the development process and the large-scale violent names of the Pamas in the early 1970s and the Gypsies in the early 1980s,

159
0:14:48,000000 --> 0:14:48,990000
they were partly named before, as well as the crawling naming of the so-called mixed marriages in 1983-1984.

160
0:14:58,000000 --> 0:14:58,990000
On the other hand, there are a few of those who, under the electoral process, only understand the culmination in the assimilation policy of the communists,

161
0:15:10,000000 --> 0:15:10,990000
when in two months, December 1984 and January 1985,

162
0:15:14,000000 --> 0:15:14,990000
more than 800,000 people were named, as well as the consequences of the event,

163
0:15:19,000000 --> 0:15:19,990000
including the provocation of mass research by the Sunni in 1989.

164
0:15:24,000000 --> 0:15:24,990000
Rumen Avramov accepted this second definition,

165
0:15:27,000000 --> 0:15:27,990000
and the core of his analysis was the period of 1984-1989.

166
0:15:34,000000 --> 0:15:34,990000
I will go into more detail about this approach.

167
0:15:40,000000 --> 0:15:40,990000
The book is multi-layered.

168
0:15:42,000000 --> 0:15:42,990000
The main layer is ethno-economic.

169
0:15:47,000000 --> 0:15:47,990000
I will choose some of the works by the authors, following their circumstances and in depth analysis,

170
0:15:54,000000 --> 0:15:54,990000
which caught my attention. I am not a specialist in the field of economics,

171
0:15:58,000000 --> 0:15:58,990000
and for many years I had not been involved in ethnic relations for many years, so I'm a little outside,

172
0:16:05,000000 --> 0:16:05,990000
so in case I get involved in an area unknown to me, I'll say it.

173
0:16:13,000000 --> 0:16:13,990000
First, the development process, including the campaigns on mass appointment and mass eviction,

174
0:16:22,000000 --> 0:16:22,990000
is not dictated by economic considerations.

175
0:16:25,000000 --> 0:16:25,990000
This is the main choice. Many people claim the opposite.

176
0:16:29,000000 --> 0:16:29,990000
In fact, in this way they expose a motivation that is not true.

177
0:16:34,000000 --> 0:16:34,990000
Exactly the opposite. The actions of the enterprise completely

178
0:16:37,000000 --> 0:16:37,990000
neglect the economic logic. This is the choice of the right wing.

179
0:16:41,000000 --> 0:16:41,990000
In the period of 1984-198888 the development process does not determine the macroeconomic balance,

180
0:16:47,000000 --> 0:16:47,990000
but only generates points of tension.

181
0:16:50,000000 --> 0:16:50,990000
3. The reasons for the change are certainly expected to be sufficient for the economy to emerge from the rails,

182
0:16:58,000000 --> 0:16:58,990000
but the environment created by the development process has a significant catalyst effect. 4. The events of the 5th of 89

183
0:17:06,000000 --> 0:17:06,990000
year strengthen the processes of long-term

184
0:17:09,000000 --> 0:17:09,990000
stop-over degradation,

185
0:17:12,000000 --> 0:17:12,990000
which is clearly reflected after the 75th year,

186
0:17:15,000000 --> 0:17:15,990000
adding to these processes a new destructive force.

187
0:17:18,000000 --> 0:17:18,990000
They accelerate

188
0:17:21,000000 --> 0:17:21,990000
the final collapse of the existing economic and political

189
0:17:24,000000 --> 0:17:24,990000
order.

190
0:17:25,000000 --> 0:17:25,990000
What impressed me most was the fact that in the middle of 1989,

191
0:17:31,000000 --> 0:17:31,990000
a return to the service and refinancing of the Bulgarian foreign debt was made,

192
0:17:35,000000 --> 0:17:35,990000
when the traditional Western creditors stopped the money or expressed their willingness to give it up only with a higher risk premium.

193
0:17:43,000000 --> 0:17:43,990000
The culmination of the economic crisis in the summer increases the risk

194
0:17:48,000000 --> 0:17:48,990000
and is the decisive battle in the final financial isolation of Bulgaria before the end of the regime.

195
0:17:57,000000 --> 0:17:57,990000
Even if the reflection of the problems of the crisis on the increase of the credit, there will be no doubt, according to the author.

196
0:18:07,000000 --> 0:18:07,990000
And another very strong analysis. The mass exodus does not cause and disrupts

197
0:18:14,000000 --> 0:18:14,990000
the natural economic relations, which give a significant boost to the decline of the economic economy.

198
0:18:19,000000 --> 0:18:19,990000
The attack against the 10K generated a bank crisis. Theal, raw currency exchange between the population is gaining a massive scale.

199
0:18:25,000000 --> 0:18:25,990000
This is how the price of the currency assets is formed, which is much more adequate than the official one.

200
0:18:30,000000 --> 0:18:30,990000
The appearance of the smart, silver-converted currency is a sure indication of the appearance of an economic space that is approaching the authentic market.

201
0:18:37,000000 --> 0:18:37,990000
And finally, the wild spirit in connection with the March

202
0:18:50,000000 --> 0:18:50,990000
and all the other developments in the gray economy in 1979

203
0:18:54,000000 --> 0:18:54,990000
are moving markets, injecting money and thus

204
0:18:58,000000 --> 0:18:58,990000
they are taking the early capital accumulation from us.

205
0:19:01,000000 --> 0:19:01,990000
Thus, the revolutionary process in its final phase plays the role of establishing the market-spot relationship.

206
0:19:07,000000 --> 0:19:07,990000
Another very important part of the book is the analysis of the totalitarian system.

207
0:19:13,000000 --> 0:19:13,990000
With its authentic descriptions, including passages from the meeting at the top,

208
0:19:18,000000 --> 0:19:18,990000
quoted by other authors, but many of them as a result of his own selection of Harumen, the author gives a significant contribution to the collection of evidence and material

209
0:19:29,000000 --> 0:19:29,990000
of the crimes of the communist regime.

210
0:19:32,000000 --> 0:19:32,990000
In this respect, the book can be read as a textbook on totalitarianism.

211
0:19:38,000000 --> 0:19:38,990000
The author gives us the opportunity to learn about the history of the social-emotional universe,

212
0:19:43,000000 --> 0:19:43,990000
which is not interested in suffering caused by people.

213
0:19:47,000000 --> 0:19:47,990000
The comparative analysis of the eviction from 1951 to 1978 is very strong, with the eviction in 1989.

214
0:19:59,000000 --> 0:19:59,990000
Because this comparative analysis allows for a number of legalities to of the legalities in these processes.

215
0:20:06,000000 --> 0:20:06,990000
The state preparation of the repressive machine was carefully monitored,

216
0:20:11,000000 --> 0:20:11,990000
just before the name of the year, with all the attributes of this machine.

217
0:20:20,000000 --> 0:20:20,990000
Increasing the inflow and inflow of goods, increasing increase of wages, the increase of money for the agency,

218
0:20:27,000000 --> 0:20:27,990000
a lot of serious deliveries of weapons, of different types of weapons.

219
0:20:33,000000 --> 0:20:33,990000
It has been shown that the Selvniches wave is the result, and this is a very important

220
0:20:37,000000 --> 0:20:37,990000
conclusion, I will read it more thoroughly, it has been shown that the Selvniches wave

221
0:20:42,000000 --> 0:20:42,990000
in 1989 is the result of manipulated movement and self-reinforcing process.

222
0:20:51,000000 --> 0:20:51,990000
This is how the statement was established that the mass settlement of hundreds of thousands of people has the nature of criminal expulsion and deportation. Ruben Avramov is not satisfied only with the discovery of the mechanisms.

223
0:21:06,000000 --> 0:21:06,990000
He reaches the tragic consequences on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

224
0:21:10,000000 --> 0:21:10,990000
This is how we reach the third very important part of the book – human suffering.

225
0:21:14,000000 --> 0:21:14,990000
This is the suffering of the taken identity, as well as the taken property and means of living.

226
0:21:20,000000 --> 0:21:20,990000
Here the healthy connection with the other two studies of his triptych,

227
0:21:25,000000 --> 0:21:25,990000
Diana Kazal is more than obvious.

228
0:21:30,000000 --> 0:21:30,990000
In the book there are separate pages that describe the family's misfortune,

229
0:21:34,000000 --> 0:21:34,990000
the consequences of which come from Turkey, or they are returned from the border after its closure in August.

230
0:21:41,000000 --> 0:21:41,990000
They have been left without money, without a home, without work, without

231
0:21:46,040000 --> 0:21:53,040000
a home, the children are stopped from school, the students cannot go to university anymore.

232
0:21:53,080000 --> 0:21:59,080000
It is the story of several thousand families in the 60s of 1989. All this is described in

233
0:21:59,120000 --> 0:22:04,120000
detail in the book. The people sold in the condition of forcing their homes, other people

234
0:22:04,160000 --> 0:22:07
live, they do not want go back to their old jobs,

235
0:22:07,000000 --> 0:22:07,990000
the children have difficulties to write them down again in school.

236
0:22:10,000000 --> 0:22:10,990000
In this situation, some of the people present here were witnesses, there is primarily an economic dimension,

237
0:22:16,000000 --> 0:22:16,990000
but also a powerful potential for violent ethnic violence. Then it could be ethnic violence,

238
0:22:25,000000 --> 0:22:25,990000
precisely because of the social problems that were affecting

239
0:22:30,000000 --> 0:22:30,990000
a large part of the territory of Bulgaria, especially the northeastern Bulgaria.

240
0:22:35,000000 --> 0:22:35,990000
The criminal deportation of several thousand people from the northeastern

241
0:22:40,000000 --> 0:22:40,990000
and northwest of Bulgaria is described. People who return from the border, which was closed, and communist regime in the form of military communism,

242
0:23:09,300000 --> 0:23:11,800000
this is the end of 1989.

243
0:23:11,800000 --> 0:23:16,100000
This is how, according to the figurative words, and Roman Avramov writes,

244
0:23:16,100000 --> 0:23:23,100000
this is how a blood-mixing combination is born, two points.

245
0:23:23,100000 --> 0:23:29
The clans of capitalism, which I spoke about a little, are moving with the last breath of the military communism,

246
0:23:29,000000 --> 0:23:29,990000
to bring a final economic shock and a gradual collapse of the communist regime in Bulgaria.

247
0:23:35,000000 --> 0:23:35,990000
There is another layer, for which I want to say two words, the civil one.

248
0:23:40,000000 --> 0:23:40,990000
It is revealed in the description of the Civil Activity after 10 November,

249
0:23:44,000000 --> 0:23:44,990000
for the restoration of the social rights of our fellow citizens.

250
0:23:47,000000 --> 0:23:47,990000
It is also described in the book.

251
0:23:49,000000 --> 0:23:49,990000
In a word, this, throughout the entire edition, Ruben Avramov does not hide his civic position on the condemnation of totalitarianism.

252
0:23:56,000000 --> 0:23:56,990000
His civic path reached its maximum in the last chapter, headed by, and I will quote it, from the second half of the book, where he is anxious to say that this is a book on the co-creation of the communist ideology with nationalism.

253
0:24:31,000000 --> 0:24:31,990000
I quote Rumen Avramov.

254
0:24:33,000000 --> 0:24:33,990000
Or, in a word, this is a book on national communism.

255
0:24:38,000000 --> 0:24:38,990000
I will say a few things on the Stolpanian aspect.

256
0:24:43,000000 --> 0:24:43,990000
The book is about economics,

257
0:24:46,000000 --> 0:24:46,990000
it is a very interesting process, but let's talk about economics.

258
0:24:50,000000 --> 0:24:50,990000
I will also mention that it is the third study of three dedicated to medicine and problems with medicine the Bulgarian history of the Moldovans.

259
0:25:06,000000 --> 0:25:06,990000
As a rumen in his typical style, he manages to connect all these episodes from the triptych,

260
0:25:18,000000 --> 0:25:18,990000
even when he finds differences between them, in the case of the economic recovery process,

261
0:25:28,000000 --> 0:25:28,990000
limited in this period, 1984-1989, he is distinguished from the other two,

262
0:25:36,000000 --> 0:25:36,990000
from the pogroms against the Greek youth in the early 20th century and the pogroms against Jewish youth in the early 40s.

263
0:25:51,000000 --> 0:25:51,990000
One of the reflections, which is especially important if we try to see some more general valid, gradual results of nationalist policies,

264
0:26:06,400000 --> 0:26:09,400000
for which there are questions in the third case,

265
0:26:09,400000 --> 0:26:16,400000
or the evasion of nationalism, even when it is not a country policy, for example.

266
0:26:18,400000 --> 0:26:29
In the third case, with the Turkish, with the Turkish process and the Turkish youth, the motive is not stupendous.

267
0:26:29,000000 --> 0:26:29,990000
And this is exactly what the Romanian exorcist outlines.

268
0:26:33,000000 --> 0:26:33,990000
Unlike the pogroms against the Greeks, especially in the case of Anch Jews, where outside the purely material Stupan things that happen and are touched at the very beginning,

269
0:26:53,000000 --> 0:26:53,990000
we have the expression of the then fashionable dominant eugenics, that is, the idea that the Stupan repression against the majority is one of the ways to make it so,

270
0:27:05,960000 --> 0:27:09,080000
to make it so, if you can say so,

271
0:27:09,080000 --> 0:27:12,280000
by eliminating the Stupan possibilities,

272
0:27:12,280000 --> 0:27:21
it will simply stop self-representing at least fully and thus be killed eventually.

273
0:27:21,000000 --> 0:27:21,990000
Not purely physical elimination, it is an extreme solution, further in the story, but the stoppance elimination is a categorical part of this ideology.

274
0:27:32,000000 --> 0:27:32,990000
In the case of the revolutionary process it is not so, but, and this is very-oriented feeding of envy, stupan envy, they have a lot, countless riches,

275
0:27:50,280000 --> 0:27:54,680000
I don't know what kind of vlogs and so on, which have been pulled out

276
0:27:54,680000 --> 0:27:58,400000
in order to justify, of course, the huge pollution of their

277
0:27:58,400000 --> 0:28:06
human dignity and life. Of course, we have reached the traditional marauding, which we have in the third episode.

278
0:28:06,000000 --> 0:28:06,990000
It is interesting how this episode, the last one, the last one, the last one, but we have the same nonsense in the third episode.

279
0:28:27,000000 --> 0:28:27,990000
We have abuse, that is, violence, here it is not a question of any market exchange, of course,

280
0:28:35,000000 --> 0:28:35,990000
violent actions in which one side is placed in a huge threat and, accordingly, it can be difficult to question a free choice, which is actually the characteristic of the market,

281
0:28:52,000000 --> 0:28:52,990000
but nevertheless there are deals. Deals that are unprofitable for one of the two sides, this of course is the side of the state of the state, both as buying and as selling. So what they have to sell is bought at a low price, what they have to buy is sold at extremely high prices.

282
0:29:11,000000 --> 0:29:11,990000
And, respectively, the presence of this agio and this agiotage, which in Bulgaria is often called specula, but Ruben used the word life, also very clearly in the text,

283
0:29:25,000000 --> 0:29:25,990000
is really a basis of the way in which many people in Bulgaria decided to enrich themselves.

284
0:29:34,000000 --> 0:29:34,990000
And subsequently they started to practice it, for me the most valuable,

285
0:29:39,000000 --> 0:29:39,990000
the penultimate chapter, not the last two with the deviations,

286
0:29:43,000000 --> 0:29:43,990000
but the one that actually is the pillars of the Stopan culture of transition in Bulgaria,

287
0:29:49,000000 --> 0:29:49,990000
which can be directly traced to what is happening, especially in the summer of 1989,

288
0:29:56,000000 --> 0:29:56,990000
as the use of separate people chaot advantage of the situation for their enrichment.

289
0:30:09,340000 --> 0:30:12,620000
Many people decided that this is how it is enriched.

290
0:30:12,700000 --> 0:30:15,240000
And, accordingly, they continued to practice it

291
0:30:15,240000 --> 0:30:17,580000
after the regime was changed.

292
0:30:19,200000 --> 0:30:21,520000
Because not a few people, really,

293
0:30:21,520000 --> 0:30:23,600000
realized big hits,

294
0:30:23,880000 --> 0:30:29
in fact, with the Stopanokane resource during this summer.

295
0:30:29,000000 --> 0:30:29,990000
In this sense, this third episode is very interesting, because it does not start with the motivation to do this,

296
0:30:38,000000 --> 0:30:38,990000
to have the Stokane measurement of this whole process.

297
0:30:42,000000 --> 0:30:42,990000
However, it is absolutely inevitable to reach all these Stopanian dimensions, which are very similar to the case in the previous two episodes,

298
0:30:49,000000 --> 0:30:49,990000
where one could say that the Stopanian motif is one of the various motifs to happen what is happening.

299
0:30:55,000000 --> 0:30:55,990000
In this sense, this last element of the triptych leads to the idea that there are some legalities, that can't be avoided, even if they are not a foresight

300
0:31:08,000000 --> 0:31:08,990000
of the people who are running towards that violence.

301
0:31:12,000000 --> 0:31:12,990000
In the end, they shine and can't be mastered.

302
0:31:16,000000 --> 0:31:16,990000
This is the first, in my opinion, very important

303
0:31:20,000000 --> 0:31:20,990000
topic, at least from those I want to underline. The second

304
0:31:24,000000 --> 0:31:24,990000
one I want to underline, yes, this can really be called

305
0:31:30,000000 --> 0:31:30,990000
a step study of National Communism or National Socialism, although for me the word is not very clear what it means. One of the things that continues to have inspiring sources is the belief that those above, those with power, can plan. Of course, during the socialist period, this with five-year plans was brought to incredible heights,

306
0:32:10,000000 --> 0:32:10,990000
this faith, but it continues to exist today in the form of the so-called mixed economy

307
0:32:18,000000 --> 0:32:18,990000
with all the interventionist attacks on the state's interventionist attacks. This market is something terribly bad.

308
0:32:26,800000 --> 0:32:33,100000
God forbid, let's not let all his problems to be manifested.

309
0:32:33,100000 --> 0:32:37,300000
That's why he needs to be regulated, he needs a wise, good, good government

310
0:32:37,300000 --> 0:32:43,100000
to take care of this state, not to show up with bad lines all the time.

311
0:32:50,000000 --> 0:32:50,990000
and not to shine with lines all the time. It is quite clear that they cannot plan. Even in countries where we have decades of experience with planning, people who really know what the question is about,

312
0:32:59,000000 --> 0:32:59,990000
they are not yet competent in the field, even a person can develop the thesis that they are quite competent.

313
0:33:06,000000 --> 0:33:06,990000
They cannot plan elementary, especially in this episode we have elementary unthoughts,

314
0:33:12,000000 --> 0:33:12,990000
elementary predictable, gradual consequences of the actions that are taken.

315
0:33:18,000000 --> 0:33:18,990000
For example, how can you not remember that there is a problem with the DSK if you drive out 300,000 people and they withdraw their money?

316
0:33:27,000000 --> 0:33:27,990000
You can't not remember that. Well, you can't remember.

317
0:33:30,000000 --> 0:33:30,990000
Not only that, but the extremely useful comparisons with the previous two waves of expulsion of the Turks,

318
0:33:39,000000 --> 0:33:39,990000
especially the expulsion from 1968, which begins in 1968 and continues for a whole decade,

319
0:33:48,000000 --> 0:33:48,990000
and how much more deliberately it is planned, but with much deeper prediction of the consequences,

320
0:33:55,000000 --> 0:33:55,990000
which would be addressed including with negotiations with Turkey.

321
0:33:59,000000 --> 0:33:59,990000
It shows a collapse of the ability of the Bulgarian socialist state's ability to plan,

322
0:34:06,000000 --> 0:34:06,990000
which can be seen in this episode in a very clear way when the two moments are contrasted,

323
0:34:12,000000 --> 0:34:12,990000
1968 versus 1984-1989.

324
0:34:16,000000 --> 0:34:16,990000
The worse the plan is, the more incompetent everything is done,

325
0:34:21,000000 --> 0:34:21,990000
the second time compared to the first. And this actually shows the whole fallout of the ability of the Bulgarian state in general,

326
0:34:34,000000 --> 0:34:34,990000
but this can of course be taken at the level of socialism,

327
0:34:38,000000 --> 0:34:38,990000
the ability of the socialist state to manage the processes with time. The more time passes, the less it begins to reduce its ability to manage public processes, including the state processes.

328
0:34:53,000000 --> 0:34:53,990000
The state cannot plan, it is surprised by all sorts of things, everywhere.

329
0:35:00,000000 --> 0:35:00,990000
And of course, then we have the general crisis of the whole socialist camp, which further weakens things,

330
0:35:07,000000 --> 0:35:07,990000
but it is obvious that at some point they just refuse to be able to cope with the problem.

331
0:35:15,000000 --> 0:35:15,990000
In fact, at some point, it is really almost officially recognized that things become uncontrolled. And this is in a country that claims that it can plan the life of people,

332
0:35:28,000000 --> 0:35:28,990000
including in its step aspect, to the smallest details. A complete failure of the idea of the planning country.

333
0:35:36,000000 --> 0:35:36,990000
And the third thing I want to stop at is precisely this transfer of the bridge to the present is not only, of course, with this it is an extremely important topic,

334
0:35:47,000000 --> 0:35:47,990000
for xenophobia and all these plundering over the centuries in the attitude of the Bulgarians to a question of the Stopan culture, of the trends of Stopan practices and from there,

335
0:36:11,000000 --> 0:36:11,990000
related to them, beliefs on how this thing is actually achieved, so-called personal enrichment or enrichment,

336
0:36:20,000000 --> 0:36:20,990000
which later became especially important. For me it interesting for me to read, especially this document, again from Politburo,

337
0:36:28,000000 --> 0:36:28,990000
I think it was from Georgi Tanah, which tells that

338
0:36:32,000000 --> 0:36:32,990000
all in all someone describes the practices of the source of state enterprises

339
0:36:36,000000 --> 0:36:36,990000
created by parallel and private structures, one by one,

340
0:36:40,000000 --> 0:36:40,990000
back in 1989.

341
0:36:44,000000 --> 0:36:44,990000
In other words, many people teach these practices, they are actually spontaneously

342
0:36:51,000000 --> 0:36:51,990000
invented back in 1989, and then we wonder why in Bulgaria they were extremely practiced, used, because there were people with experience who saw the schemes, saw that these schemes

343
0:37:07,000000 --> 0:37:07,990000
work, that they lead to results and then in the immobility of the first years of transition,

344
0:37:13,000000 --> 0:37:13,990000
in which a person can easily see how almost permanently the state resource was left

345
0:37:20,000000 --> 0:37:20,990000
immobile, these schemes are simply reproduced, of course, on a huge scale and give rise to extremely vile riches in the Bulgar of lack of choice, of not freedom, in case of extremely violent not freedom. in the hope of acting in a certain way and, accordingly, to make compromises with material things,

346
0:38:07,000000 --> 0:38:07,990000
which they would not have done if they had freedom.

347
0:38:10,000000 --> 0:38:10,990000
Many Bulgarian businessmen to this day can be told in detail, even those who were then 8-9 years old,

348
0:38:19,000000 --> 0:38:19,990000
we will not mention names, they present themselves with a step-by himself as a success in this way. I succeed and win when the other side is pressed,

349
0:38:28,000000 --> 0:38:28,990000
in a situation of lack of freedom, of the impossibility to act,

350
0:38:32,000000 --> 0:38:32,990000
threatened by some circumstances, and then I make a deal with her.

351
0:38:37,000000 --> 0:38:37,990000
And this is a great businessman who lives as a successful man at 33. This is a practice that RUME really clearly shows during this summer.

352
0:38:50,000000 --> 0:38:50,990000
People are forced to sell what is their priceless,

353
0:38:56,000000 --> 0:38:56,990000
and they are also forced to buy things they need for where they go,

354
0:39:03,000000 --> 0:39:03,990000
and, accordingly, they are forced to buy them at an incredibly high price,

355
0:39:07,000000 --> 0:39:07,990000
a price that, other than in Bulgaria, can never be reached.

356
0:39:17,000000 --> 0:39:17,990000
So, if we take the dollar exchange rate as the best price, then in Kyrgyzstan and those numbers that Rumen gives 20-25 leva, in Sofia at that moment, I remember because we were back Kurdistan. So, you can see what a movement has been made. And the dollar represents everything that these people wanted to buy,

357
0:39:52,080000 --> 0:39:59,080000
including things that they wanted to bring to the countries they go to. And, accordingly,

358
0:39:59,080000 --> 0:40:06
yes, I'm finishing. Accordingly, very, very of them. Today you will imagine that this is how you succeed.

359
0:40:06,000000 --> 0:40:06,990000
You succeed, of course, they use the state at the moment to force the other side to be in an unfavorable situation,

360
0:40:13,000000 --> 0:40:13,990000
or to be banned, or some under-reliable businessman to resolve the disputes.

361
0:40:21,000000 --> 0:40:21,990000
If such disputes arise, the other side knows it, to be forced to conclude a deal with them, and they consider this a great business skill.

362
0:40:32,000000 --> 0:40:32,990000
Obviously, this is not capitalism that creates wealth, this, they have investigated this, crony capitalism or robber capitalism.

363
0:40:48,000000 --> 0:40:48,990000
So the creeds of this phenomenon,

364
0:40:50,000000 --> 0:40:50,990000
which is a big problem in Bulgaria,

365
0:40:52,000000 --> 0:40:52,990000
can also be seen in this

366
0:40:56,000000 --> 0:40:56,990000
fateful summer of 1989.

367
0:41:01,000000 --> 0:41:01,990000
I want to say that these three steps

368
0:41:04,000000 --> 0:41:04,990000
actually looked at each other.

369
0:41:05,000000 --> 0:41:05,990000
Each one looked at the previous one, increased the previous one,

370
0:41:09,000000 --> 0:41:09,990000
added, somehow overcame the previous one or two.

371
0:41:14,000000 --> 0:41:14,990000
But unlike the previous two, in this third moment, this second turn,

372
0:41:18,000000 --> 0:41:18,990000
the economy had to find itself.

373
0:41:21,000000 --> 0:41:21,990000
This is what Gogata says, this is what Misho says,

374
0:41:24,000000 --> 0:41:24,990000
and really this is one ofata says, this is what Misho says and this is really one of the

375
0:41:26,000000 --> 0:41:26,990000
surprises in this topic. The lack of clear economic motivation in everything that is said and

376
0:41:33,000000 --> 0:41:33,990000
told. Everything is flooded, everything is thrown away and stuck by ideology, politics, national

377
0:41:39,000000 --> 0:41:39,990000
certainty and these motives, these words that are mentioned in the book and in everything that is said about it,

378
0:41:48,000000 --> 0:41:48,990000
this realistic, authentic fear of Turkey, these existential difficulties of living with a minority

379
0:41:55,000000 --> 0:41:55,990000
that comes from a neighboring country and is connected to a neighboring country,

380
0:42:00,000000 --> 0:42:00,990000
which is a barrier between the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the experience of eviction and the investments went to the economy. The recovery process these four years actually capsules all these motives in an

381
0:42:30,000000 --> 0:42:30,990000
unusual way, in an incredibly intense way and everything that happened in 45 decades before that. The economy is not a common place, I will say it myself,

382
0:42:47,000000 --> 0:42:47,990000
in the Gologi and in the Nino, in the Misho.

383
0:42:50,000000 --> 0:42:50,990000
It is not a cause, it is a consequence.

384
0:42:53,000000 --> 0:42:53,990000
Therefore, it is not a calculated consequence in this case.

385
0:42:56,000000 --> 0:42:56,990000
It is a preventable consequence for those who take the decision

386
0:42:59,000000 --> 0:42:59,990000
and it is not taken into account by those who take the decision.

387
0:43:02,000000 --> 0:43:02,990000
But its consequences, otherwise, felt in the Bulgarian economic, social and political life during these four years.

388
0:43:12,000000 --> 0:43:12,990000
It can be clear, I actually look at different places.

389
0:43:17,000000 --> 0:43:17,990000
Not one price is formed, but many prices are formed, prices of this paranoia that started in 1974 and in 1989.

390
0:43:28,000000 --> 0:43:28,990000
In fact, these are very non-additive prices, they cannot be added, they cannot be lost, they cannot be collected at the same price.

391
0:43:36,000000 --> 0:43:36,990000
They should be viewed and discussed in the book in parallel, sequentially, as several different consequential consequences, economic consequences from this political decision.

392
0:43:47,000000 --> 0:43:47,990000
We have the bearable initial phase of the production process, the phase of assimilation,

393
0:43:54,000000 --> 0:43:54,990000
which also provides a very clear economic context.

394
0:43:59,000000 --> 0:43:59,990000
For example, it allowed me to discuss, perhaps, some of the first in the budget of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

395
0:44:05,000000 --> 0:44:05,990000
which are included in the committee's dossiers, and to see how this story of the attempt to assimilate Bulgaria is written in the numerous decisions the parties and the state try to buy the loyalty of the Turks,

396
0:44:29,000000 --> 0:44:29,990000
to soften in their vision, in their presentation, what they do,

397
0:44:35,000000 --> 0:44:35,990000
by giving, by moving with the spirit of the community, by trying to increase in some way,

398
0:44:41,000000 --> 0:44:41,990000
it becomes unsuccessful, in fact, the standard of living in the affected areas.

399
0:44:46,000000 --> 0:44:46,990000
But of course the consequences are the 1989 and these are the terminal shocks for the regime in general.

400
0:44:53,000000 --> 0:44:53,990000
In these few months, absolutely classic economic plots also appear, for example the attack attack against DSK. A subject that we learned in 1996-1997, we learned in 2014,

401
0:45:08,000000 --> 0:45:08,990000
this is a case that happened before our eyes, and we thought that this is a subject related to some forms of capitalism.

402
0:45:17,000000 --> 0:45:17,990000
In fact, in the year of 1989 we have a classic example of the attack of the investors against a bank and

403
0:45:27,000000 --> 0:45:27,990000
this bank manages to withstand these years, of course, thanks to the system, the specific

404
0:45:34,000000 --> 0:45:34,990000
system in which the DSK works for these years. Of course, there are also problems with the

405
0:45:41,000000 --> 0:45:41,990000
external debt, which we mentioned before mentioned, and others, which are purely classical

406
0:45:46,000000 --> 0:45:46,990000
economic problems, as the last force of this political solution. Here, for the economist,

407
0:45:51,000000 --> 0:45:51,990000
the question is to assess how much the productive process, the political event, is a self-catalyzer

408
0:45:58,000000 --> 0:45:58,990000
, how much without it the processes would have developed longer and longer, but the same catastrophic

409
0:46:06,000000 --> 0:46:06,990000
outcome as it occurred in 1989-1990. And finally, this is the economic

410
0:46:14,000000 --> 0:46:14,990000
gap. I will quote the words from Krish, this is the blood-stained mixture between the mix between proto-capitalism, the manifestation of a stichy, wild capitalism, spontaneous capitalism

411
0:46:30,000000 --> 0:46:30,990000
and what the state does, all the loopholes of military communism it has proposed in the last months of the Zizkov regime.

412
0:46:38,000000 --> 0:46:38,990000
Here are, as my colleagues said, the crowns of the brutality and the economic deviations of the last transition. the In fact, it was clear that the weakness of the so-called normative principles in economics,

413
0:47:10,000000 --> 0:47:10,990000
which we all as economists agree on, was a lesson in modesty for the economic science.

414
0:47:17,000000 --> 0:47:17,990000
It was very clear that in the context of the external, including ideological extreme situations we are in.

415
0:47:26,000000 --> 0:47:26,990000
And it was actually seen that we are in a state of permanent alienation.

416
0:47:34,000000 --> 0:47:34,990000
And this is exactly the connection of our events with today's events.

417
0:47:38,000000 --> 0:47:38,990000
Because today's alienation and today's exclusivity is the return to the era of nationalism, in which local retrograde is deliberately dedicated to the West.

418
0:47:50,000000 --> 0:47:50,990000
The former headline sends to the future, which we are in the case, a miraculous message.

419
0:47:56,000000 --> 0:47:56,990000
The States become a rock, and Europe becomes a failed country.

420
0:48:00,000000 --> 0:48:00,990000
In general, as Dr. Mikhailov, who is here, said, the big thing is to see that there is no good in the good.

421
0:48:06,000000 --> 0:48:06,990000
I said good, but the big thing is to see that there is no reason in the reason.

422
0:48:09,000000 --> 0:48:09,990000
Exactly 10 years ago, in 2001, I presented the book The Capitalism,

423
0:48:14,000000 --> 0:48:14,990000
which was a book about the triumphing liberalism and its

424
0:48:17,180000 --> 0:48:20
misappropriation of Bulgarian conditions.

425
0:48:20,000000 --> 0:48:20,990000
In the next 10 years, I was immersed in the economic and social hypostases of violence in Bulgaria.

426
0:48:31,000000 --> 0:48:31,990000
I was late with the first one, until 2008. After 2008, the Liberal Party's parliamentary

427
0:48:40,000000 --> 0:48:40,990000
council, in the day of the resurrection, was blinded by our minds and it was pressed into the corner.

428
0:48:45,000000 --> 0:48:45,990000
And with the storm as a surprise I walked in front of the events, in front of the waves

429
0:48:50,000000 --> 0:48:50,990000
of nationalism, intolerance and authoritarianism. I still think that these waves are temporary,

430
0:48:56,000000 --> 0:48:56,990000
even though they were in a state of state for a long time. While we are in them,

431
0:49:01,000000 --> 0:49:01,990000
while we are drowned in them, I think that every anti-utopia, every Orwellian and the founder of 1984 will be still impossible.

432
0:49:09,000000 --> 0:49:09,990000
And this is the problem that is in front of us at the moment.
