In April, 38 years ago, an accident occurred in a nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was damaged.

9
0:00:26 --> 0:00:30
It is the most severe in the history of nuclear power.

10
0:00:30 --> 0:00:33
But the problem is not only in this.

11
0:00:33 --> 0:00:37
The communist government in Bulgaria is hiding the information about the incident.

12
0:00:38 --> 0:00:44
While the police are protesting, people are eating with a spicy spring salad.

13
0:00:44 --> 0:00:47
The radioactive cloud is over Bulgaria.

14
0:00:47 --> 0:00:52
The communist nomenclature drinks mineral water and eats proven food.

15
0:00:52 --> 0:00:55
Who will change the measures against radiation?

16
0:00:55 --> 0:00:59
We will talk to Professor Dimitar Vatsov from the New Bulgarian University.

17
0:00:59 --> 0:01:03
He is the author of the research Archaeology of Moral Debilism.

18
0:01:03 --> 0:01:05
Hello, Professor Vilism. Hello, professor Batze.

19
0:01:05 --> 0:01:06
Hello.

20
0:01:06 --> 0:01:08
Let's start chronologically.

21
0:01:08 --> 0:01:10
This event is happening.

22
0:01:10 --> 0:01:15
Mira is even doing a quick research in the library.

23
0:01:15 --> 0:01:17
A review of the seal.

24
0:01:17 --> 0:01:21
To see how this event is reflected.

25
0:01:21 --> 0:01:28
And since we are already moving away from it, it is good to start chronologically.

26
0:01:28 --> 0:01:33
How did it start and how do we understand in Bulgaria that such an accident happened?

27
0:01:35 --> 0:01:40
As for the accident in Chernobyl, we understand from the work department,

28
0:01:40 --> 0:01:43
if I am not mistaken, the first publication on April 28,

29
0:01:43 --> 0:01:46,900000
in which they say that the accident happened,

30
0:01:46,900000 --> 0:01:50
and they say and do not mention anything about any risks

31
0:01:50 --> 0:01:52
that concern the Bulgarian country.

32
0:01:52 --> 0:01:55
In the next few days,

33
0:01:55 --> 0:01:57
in two days in total,

34
0:01:57 --> 0:01:59
the Committee for Atomic Energy

35
0:01:59 --> 0:02:03,500000
publishes again through BTA and through the Labor Department

36
0:02:03,500000 --> 0:02:09
short messages explaining that there is no danger to the population until the 6th of May.

37
0:02:09 --> 0:02:13,600000
So, in fact, the government is hiding, although it knows perfectly well what is happening.

38
0:02:13,600000 --> 0:02:20
The Soviet ambassador was warned by the witness of the protection of Todor Zhivkov

39
0:02:20 --> 0:02:25,500000
a few days before the radioactive rains in Bulgaria arrived, that is, at the end of April.

40
0:02:25,500000 --> 0:02:30,500000
The radiation in the country begins to be measured from April 30.

41
0:02:30,500000 --> 0:02:46
From May 1-2, measures for a full winter, full measures, full quarantine on food, water, The number of the party's positions is the number of the party's positions.

42
0:02:46 --> 0:02:50
These are the CK of the BKP, the secretariat and the Politburo,

43
0:02:50 --> 0:02:53
and those positions in the country, including the government,

44
0:02:53 --> 0:02:55
which are their own positions.

45
0:02:55 --> 0:02:57
These people are fully taken care of.

46
0:02:57 --> 0:03:01
Even from the first days of the radiation coming,

47
0:03:01 --> 0:03:04
the radiation comes here on the 1st and 2nd of May.

48
0:03:04 --> 0:03:09
Because this is not a cloud that can be poured evenly everywhere.

49
0:03:09 --> 0:03:13
It is just rain in this period on May 1st and 2nd.

50
0:03:13 --> 0:03:17
Then the situation in Bulgaria becomes very difficult.

51
0:03:17 --> 0:03:24
I am joking that there are three conditions in Bulgaria at that time.

52
0:03:24 --> 0:03:26,560000
Something like the Platon state.

53
0:03:26,560000 --> 0:03:34,120000
The kings sit on the top, the guards are on the bottom as the second category, and the tenants and tenants sit at the lowest.

54
0:03:34,120000 --> 0:03:37,560000
In the Bulgarian case, the nomenclature is on the top.

55
0:03:37,560000 --> 0:04:06
The category of the guards was once composed by the soldiers who were better protected, The in Vrana, in Krichim, in many places there have been settlements, the harvest is drunk by deep-frozen water.

56
0:04:06 --> 0:04:09
What...

57
0:04:09 --> 0:04:12
So, water is the brightest criterion.

58
0:04:12 --> 0:04:15
The nomenclature drinks mineral water

59
0:04:15 --> 0:04:18
and swallows deep-frozen water

60
0:04:18 --> 0:04:21
so that it is not infected.

61
0:04:21 --> 0:04:24
The harvest of the nomenclature drinks deep-frozen water,

62
0:04:24 --> 0:04:31
and the entire population drinks water from the Iskara and other open water springs.

63
0:04:31 --> 0:04:52
So the animals for the special ones are placed at a animals that give the milk and the meat for the nomenclature are the middle class, they are the higher class than the Bulgarian population.

64
0:04:52 --> 0:05:10
Ten times less the soldiers were clothed, thanks to hand, this is one of the shocking results of these measurements,

65
0:05:10 --> 0:05:15
it turned out that one in ten soldiers is very seriously infected.

66
0:05:15 --> 0:05:19
When they checked why this happened, it turned out that this is usually the cook,

67
0:05:19 --> 0:05:22
the one who washes the products.

68
0:05:22 --> 0:05:26
Yes, because everything is left with it, it is liquid. Exactly, yes.

69
0:05:26 --> 0:05:36
So the difference is significant between the amount of radiation that the ordinary people and the soldiers have consumed.

70
0:05:36 --> 0:05:46
We can also say that there are differences in the amount of radiation that was consumed collected, but we don't have any research on it,

71
0:05:49 --> 0:05:50
the people who have been exposed to the work of the discovery.

72
0:05:55 --> 0:05:56
Such are the rural brigades, the whole rural cycle,

73
0:06:00 --> 0:06:01
probably such are the minors who work on discovered careers,

74
0:06:03 --> 0:06:04
but there is no research on this.

75
0:06:11 --> 0:06:17
There is research on the fact that, let's the very high levels of radiation of the brigadiers who worked in the Rose Valley. The Rose Valley in May is one of the most seriously infected in Bulgaria.

76
0:06:17 --> 0:06:25
And we made such a comparative measurement between people from the Rose, who participated in the Rose Party at that time.

77
0:06:25 --> 0:06:27
At that time the roses were collected.

78
0:06:27 --> 0:06:33
Yes, the roses were collected. They are both locals and brigadiers who were there.

79
0:06:33 --> 0:06:48
And people from Sofia. And again there is several times, three times the difference in the surrounding between those who worked in the field and those who moved without knowing how to maintain hygiene, especially on the Sofia streets.

80
0:06:49 --> 0:06:52
Only in Bulgaria we have a second radiation peak.

81
0:06:53 --> 0:07:05,340000
April, May, June 1987, the food in Bulgaria reached radiation values equal and higher than those that were in May 1986.

82
0:07:05,340000 --> 0:07:11,340000
This second radiation peak, the Bosque one, which you showed, is called the Bulgarian Chernobyl

83
0:07:11,340000 --> 0:07:13,340000
because it is only here.

84
0:07:13,340000 --> 0:07:19,340000
And it is due to the fact that, even though they have been repeatedly warned by these

85
0:07:19,340000 --> 0:07:26
scientists, the authorities have used the winter of 1986-1987

86
0:07:26 --> 0:07:29
the ban on furage for animals.

87
0:07:29 --> 0:07:34
From here, the milk and meat increase the radioactivity extremely much.

88
0:07:34 --> 0:07:39
You could buy furage from outside, clean it when it is not available.

89
0:07:39 --> 0:07:55
There is no such experiment. Because of this, according to their calculations, about 30% of the population's consumption of radioactive meat and milk comes from the one year after the accident.

90
0:07:55 --> 0:08:05
So, this is completely intentional, completely consciously, the leadership of Bulgaria, then the Communist Party, decides to save money and not buy new furage,

91
0:08:05 --> 0:08:09
and to feed the population with radioactive material.

92
0:08:09 --> 0:08:11
Through animals and milk.

93
0:08:11 --> 0:08:13
Exactly.

94
0:08:13 --> 0:08:19
When you read the documents I have been dealing with in the last few years

95
0:08:19 --> 0:08:28
on the Bulgarian Chernobyl case, you can be seen that the main motivation of the authorities was to buy a truck,

96
0:08:28 --> 0:08:41
but also to stop the brigades, the children's camps, because 450,000 children were at sea in May, June, July 1986.

97
0:08:41 --> 0:08:42
At the camp.

98
0:08:42 --> 0:08:46
At the camp. 365,000 brigadiers were sent to the field.

99
0:08:46 --> 0:08:48
Imagine,

100
0:08:48 --> 0:08:50
almost 800,000

101
0:08:50 --> 0:08:52
young people

102
0:08:52 --> 0:08:54
were actually subjected to heavy radiation.

103
0:08:56 --> 0:08:58
This thing, when it was seen,

104
0:08:58 --> 0:09:00
it was not expressed anywhere,

105
0:09:00 --> 0:09:02
no one dared to say it,

106
0:09:02 --> 0:09:04
but it is seen that

107
0:09:04 --> 0:09:08
the main argument for this is that there is no economic damage.

108
0:09:08 --> 0:09:38
First, no one will pick up the harvest, and for the children's camps there is a special fear that the foreigners of the sea will be lost, the hard wave, if it is heard that where you refer to the testimonies from the case, in fact, it is mentioned there about tourism, that this is one of the reasons not to tell people not to be heard and the summer season to be broken.

109
0:09:38 --> 0:09:51
This is officially given as a testimony by one of the then responsible for tourism? Yes, then the head of the Bulgarian Association for Tourism and Restoration, for example, was.

110
0:09:51 --> 0:09:58
He clearly says how he walked, insisted, lobbied to release reassuring messages

111
0:09:58 --> 0:10:17
so that the tourist infl is completely clean and safe.

112
0:10:17 --> 0:10:27
At the same time, we can say that samples of sand are taken in Efsinogsinograd, from the Bungalo beach, I think it was called.

113
0:10:27 --> 0:10:29
This is the government beach, let's say.

114
0:10:29 --> 0:10:34
This is the government beach and special, non-contamination measures are taken there.

115
0:10:34 --> 0:10:47
That is, you declare that and protocols of the Central Committee,

116
0:10:47 --> 0:10:55
is there any higher nomenclature that could have been used to say that this is genocide against the people,

117
0:10:55 --> 0:11:03
that they kill people in practice, very consciously, especially children, young people and young people,

118
0:11:03 --> 0:11:05
who are consciously

119
0:11:05 --> 0:11:09
throwing them out in conditions they would not be in.

120
0:11:09 --> 0:11:14
One of the most impressive things, I call it moral debilitation,

121
0:11:14 --> 0:11:17
is that these people know perfectly well what needs to be done,

122
0:11:17 --> 0:11:22
they do it for themselves, they are fully rational and at the same time

123
0:11:22 --> 0:11:27,340000
refuse to do it for others. And they don't have a moral problem, some kind of conscience.

124
0:11:27,340000 --> 0:11:35,760000
I don't find a note of apology or regret in these documents.

125
0:11:35,760000 --> 0:11:38,760000
One window has been open for about two weeks,

126
0:11:38,760000 --> 0:11:42,760000
in which the authorities admit that there is a problem with half of the people.

127
0:11:42,760000 --> 0:11:48
In fact, in that first interview of Shinderov, which is by order of Grigor Stoichkov,

128
0:11:48 --> 0:11:52
this is proven, that is, it was his government's decision to come out,

129
0:11:52 --> 0:11:57
together with Ivan Pandev, the head of the then Committee on Nuclear Energy.

130
0:11:57 --> 0:12:01
Ivan Pandev, so to speak, shamelessly lies that there is nothing.

131
0:12:01 --> 0:12:05
Shinderov, nevertheless, with an infinitely soothing tone,

132
0:12:05 --> 0:12:09
manages to say that it is good not to eat

133
0:12:09 --> 0:12:13
fox grass, i.e. marula, spinach, etc.

134
0:12:13 --> 0:12:16
It is good for the children not to go into the shower

135
0:12:16 --> 0:12:19
and it is good to wash more often.

136
0:12:19 --> 0:12:22
These are the measures that Shindarov recommends

137
0:12:22 --> 0:12:28
with half of this TV interview, in the jury totally reassures the audience.

138
0:12:28 --> 0:12:34,500000
And from May 7th to May 24th, when it was announced that nothing was left,

139
0:12:34,500000 --> 0:12:39
and everything was over, there are several messages that it should be mentioned

140
0:12:39 --> 0:12:41,500000
that there should be such elementary hygiene measures.

141
0:12:41,500000 --> 0:12:48
This is a period of some kind of opening of information to the population, but it is extremely minimal.

142
0:12:48 --> 0:12:55
How do these messages pass? On TV or somewhere in the news?

143
0:12:55 --> 0:13:11
On May 7, the interview of Shindarov is on TV, the only Bulgarian TV at that time. On May 24th the message about the change of measures was published by BTA

144
0:13:11 --> 0:13:14
and reprinted by all newspapers and quoted by the TV.

145
0:13:14 --> 0:13:17
We have a very interesting picture on the wall.

146
0:13:17 --> 0:13:21
Colleagues have taken Mara Maleeva and Todor Zhivkov to a banquet.

147
0:13:21 --> 0:13:25
She is not alive, I think, by this moment. Mara Maleeva.

148
0:13:25 --> 0:13:26
No, yes.

149
0:13:26 --> 0:13:27
So...

150
0:13:27 --> 0:13:30
This is food for them.

151
0:13:30 --> 0:13:32
She is not alive, she is 86 years old.

152
0:13:32 --> 0:13:34
Mrs. Maleeva.

153
0:13:34 --> 0:13:38
The other woman is Maleeva, so the picture is illustrative, let's say.

154
0:13:38 --> 0:13:45
Yes, but it shows the path of the government?

155
0:13:45 --> 0:13:57
The testimonies show that in the residence in Bojana

156
0:13:57 --> 0:14:10
not only the food was thoroughly checked. UBO was the only organization that the Institute for X-ray and radiobiology

157
0:14:10 --> 0:14:17
has such a dosimeter, which allows to check all products in place.

158
0:14:17 --> 0:14:23
To say only with two words UBO what is, this is the security and security management?

159
0:14:23 --> 0:14:25
This is part of the State Security Department,

160
0:14:25 --> 0:14:27
of the Secret Police.

161
0:14:27 --> 0:14:30
This is the responsibility of the State Security Department,

162
0:14:30 --> 0:14:36
which is responsible for the protection of the party and state leaders.

163
0:14:36 --> 0:14:38
And the second time, however,

164
0:14:38 --> 0:14:47
it was responsible for their health and their luxury. ULBOL has been contributing to the wealth of the country,

165
0:14:47 --> 0:14:52
it has been monitoring the food of the other leaders,

166
0:14:52 --> 0:14:56
there have been chemical laboratories for chemical analysis,

167
0:14:56 --> 0:14:59
radiological laboratories for radiation analysis,

168
0:14:59 --> 0:15:02
with the latest equipment.

169
0:15:02 --> 0:15:05
This is an organization that acts flawlessly.

170
0:15:05 --> 0:15:08
Back then its leader was the terrible General Kashev,

171
0:15:08 --> 0:15:11
who later, in the same year, in 1986,

172
0:15:11 --> 0:15:14
in the autumn, committed suicide under certain circumstances.

173
0:15:16 --> 0:15:19
But he managed to take action,

174
0:15:19 --> 0:15:22
so he indeed from the 1st and 2nd of May

175
0:15:22 --> 0:15:30
made absolute full control over the food and living conditions of the High Party of the Nomenclature.

176
0:15:30 --> 0:15:52,480000
Not all of them received such a generous amount. According to the historians of Alexander Venkov, for example, there are about 9000 people in the end of socialism. In total, there are probably about 500-600 people who are on the edge of the fence, on the edge of the fence of the street.

177
0:15:52,480000 --> 0:15:54,480000
On the edge of the fence.

178
0:15:54,480000 --> 0:15:57,480000
On the edge of the fence, on which they are carried at home.

179
0:15:57,480000 --> 0:16:03,480000
Let's say that it is not only that they have to go to the special tables, restaurants of the street.

180
0:16:03,480000 --> 0:16:07,800000
Something unthinkable at that time, delivery to homes.

181
0:16:07,800000 --> 0:16:11
And it was luxurious, except that it was clean, luxurious food.

182
0:16:11 --> 0:16:16
I am clarifying it from the point of view that many young people who most likely watch us,

183
0:16:16 --> 0:16:20
they can't even imagine that you can't call and order food.

184
0:16:20 --> 0:16:30
They can't even imagine how the newspapers look like at the moment. Actually, we have, maybe the colleagues can leave some of the publications as photos.

185
0:16:30 --> 0:16:50
In such a moment when something is actually unheard of throughout Europe and it harms a huge number of territories and people, The Bulgarian newspapers publish messages about which shops will be open during the holidays, how will they work,

186
0:16:50 --> 0:16:54
the weather, the photos, when the sports day will be held.

187
0:16:54 --> 0:17:01
On the 27th and 28th, a small postman comes out and says that the demonstration will be held as it is,

188
0:17:01 --> 0:17:07
which streets will be. And in general, it is a life that is wonderful.

189
0:17:07 --> 0:17:14
There is even something interesting on April 27th,

190
0:17:14 --> 0:17:17
it says that we have a lot of problems with Libya, Managua and Seoul.

191
0:17:17 --> 0:17:21
We are very worried about what is happening to the people there.

192
0:17:21 --> 0:17:24
For Chernobyl, there is nothing on the front page.

193
0:17:24 --> 0:17:29
After that, this is something, a period that is very difficult to be understood by people who have not lived it.

194
0:17:29 --> 0:17:36
That's right. Most Bulgarians at that time, although slightly, mainly through Western radio stations,

195
0:17:36 --> 0:17:40
they are heard and through close ones. I can tell you a memory.

196
0:17:40 --> 0:17:51
The late Professor Iva Ivo Znapolsky, before he left, had the chance to tell me that he was in Cannes at that time, at the Cannes Film Festival.

197
0:17:51 --> 0:18:12
And as he met his wife, he told her to pick you a salad or a meal, they came with a dosimeter to show you that you are not infected.

198
0:18:12 --> 0:18:27
And here nobody knew. Nobody knew, but he strongly said, and I will return works by Ubo.

199
0:18:27 --> 0:18:34
One of them is that while people in Sofia walk on the streets in Vrana,

200
0:18:34 --> 0:18:48
which is a workshop of Ubo, local workers are told to dig out and remove the upper layer of the cocos from the cocos,

201
0:18:48 --> 0:19:07
after which they are allowed to go on clean terrain, on non-infected radiationous terrain. They sell the grass that was lost in the beginning of May,

202
0:19:07 --> 0:19:12
they burn it in the spring, and instead of throwing it away or burning it,

203
0:19:12 --> 0:19:17
because it is radioactive, they sell it to the Stupanskoe association of Sardinians.

204
0:19:17 --> 0:19:22
That is, it goes to feed the animals that give milk to the Sofians.

205
0:19:33 --> 0:19:53
milk for Sofians. UBOL for the nomenclature buys a huge amount of powder milk, which they refuse to drink because they are getting sick of it, and they are provided with milk that is clean enough, but it the children's gardens and hospitals, and in the trade network radioactive milk was released, produced only here, on a general basis.

206
0:19:53 --> 0:20:11
Then the poor returned it, but it was simply sealed, temporarily, for any case, so take them. While others, while people and children, including in the children's gardens, drink radioactive milk.

207
0:20:11 --> 0:20:34
Such radioactive milk is released again on dust in this case. It is released even in the spring of 1987, there is radiation, because if the information is true, they try to release information and control some measures to take, they try through the so-called circular national councils.

208
0:20:34 --> 0:20:48
And they were informed about what measures to take and they were entrusted with responsibility, because some measures are taken by the state. Let's say that. It takes measures, they are very impressive,

209
0:20:48 --> 0:20:53
to control the food, the milk and the meat.

210
0:20:53 --> 0:20:55
How does it control them?

211
0:20:55 --> 0:21:00
Production is almost not thrown out, but it is mixed.

212
0:21:00 --> 0:21:10
The meat is ground and mixed with a stronger radioactive agent, so that it can enter the norm, which is just invented.

213
0:21:10 --> 0:21:12
It was raised specifically for this purpose.

214
0:21:12 --> 0:21:22
But still, to enter it, we mix different milk from different villages that are in the big milk plant.

215
0:21:22 --> 0:21:26
Is this documented somewhere as an order?

216
0:21:26 --> 0:21:27
Yes, it is.

217
0:21:27 --> 0:21:31
How is it formulated in the socialist language?

218
0:21:31 --> 0:21:36
These are orders to the leaders of the Stupan associations.

219
0:21:36 --> 0:21:40
These are Rodopa for the meat, Mlechna Promisleno for the milk,

220
0:21:40 --> 0:21:44
Bulgar Plot for the fruits and vegetables,

221
0:21:44 --> 0:21:46
Bilk Co-opop for herbs, several.

222
0:21:46 --> 0:21:49
But this is the moment when we know about the accident

223
0:21:49 --> 0:21:52
and write why these mixtures are being made.

224
0:21:52 --> 0:21:55
This is from the very beginning, this information is down.

225
0:21:55 --> 0:21:56
But how do you explain it?

226
0:21:56 --> 0:22:00
You dilute the milk from the plum with the milk from the bulgur.

227
0:22:00 --> 0:22:03
Because they engage a number of laboratories,

228
0:22:03 --> 0:22:11
the Souskostopanska Studies of several institutes in Sofia to work and monitor these products and measure them.

229
0:22:11 --> 0:22:19
Yes, but how is it distributed? Mix it with this milk, do people know why they have to mix cream with milk?

230
0:22:19 --> 0:22:21
The workers don't.

231
0:22:21 --> 0:22:26
It just means that you have to mix them. Yes.

232
0:22:26 --> 0:22:28
The workers don't know.

233
0:22:28 --> 0:22:38
The workers were probably suffering because the radiation is being placed in the tanks, in the machines, in the air.

234
0:22:38 --> 0:22:41
But such studies have not been made.

235
0:22:41 --> 0:22:49
At least I haven't been seen such cases. Have you done any research on the impact of this on the health of the population

236
0:22:49 --> 0:22:55
in the next 10, 15, 20 years, because we are already approaching 40 years?

237
0:22:55 --> 0:23:00
There is no... For example, there is medical examination in the field.

238
0:23:00 --> 0:23:07
This medical examination allows to make probability calculations

239
0:23:07 --> 0:23:14
for how much the cancer patients will be affected by the exposure,

240
0:23:14 --> 0:23:20
how much the cancer of the thyroid gland will be, thanks to the iodine-131,

241
0:23:20 --> 0:23:30
what malformations can can be expected during pregnancy. A number of such measurements and calculations have been made.

242
0:23:30 --> 0:23:38
I must say first that the connection between the illness and the radiation is not proven as a direct cause of the connection.

243
0:23:38 --> 0:23:43
We cannot say that this person got sick from cancer thanks to the radiation.

244
0:23:43 --> 0:23:45
We do not know what causes cancer.

245
0:23:45 --> 0:23:51
Therefore, the effect of radiation on people's health is calculated mathematically.

246
0:23:51 --> 0:23:54
It is calculated how many more cases can be expected

247
0:23:54 --> 0:24:00
as this factor also enters the factors that form, let's say,

248
0:24:00 --> 0:24:02
the assumptions for cancer and diseases.

249
0:24:02 --> 0:24:05
And according to these calculations of the medical examinations,

250
0:24:05 --> 0:24:13
according to the case from the beginning of the 90s, from a few dozens, from 50-60 to a few

251
0:24:13 --> 0:24:20
hundred, 500-600 people should die, for example, from cancer, due to the degree of

252
0:24:20 --> 0:24:25
radiation that is being emitted by the divine presence. There is the future of the population.

253
0:24:31 --> 0:24:35
There is a lot of data, but I don't know if anyone seriously has sat down to collect them first and generalize them. I hope we will be able to do this with collective effort to make it happen.

254
0:24:37 --> 0:24:49
And to make a precise overall statistic for how much radiation can be seen as a factor for increasing some diseases.

255
0:24:49 --> 0:24:56
An American colleague who is studying the duration of life in Eastern Europe

256
0:24:56 --> 0:24:59
published a book in which something very strange is seen.

257
0:24:59 --> 0:25:03
In all of Eastern Europe the so-called expected duration of life,

258
0:25:03 --> 0:25:10
expected because it is again a statistical size, falls sharply after 1989.

259
0:25:10 --> 0:25:16
Because the system is breaking down, a number of factors affect

260
0:25:16 --> 0:25:19
and this is a common phenomenon for Eastern Europe.

261
0:25:19 --> 0:25:23
In Bulgaria it fell from 1987, two years earlier.

262
0:25:23 --> 0:25:25
What is the explanation for this?

263
0:25:25 --> 0:25:27
Well, maybe one of the explanations is Chernobyl.
